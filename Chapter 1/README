This chapter of TAME Toolkit training modules begins with introductory-level training on setting up R/R Studio, coding, data organization basics, basic methods to identify and visualize trends in data, and visualize high-dimensional data (modules 1.1-1.4). Introductory data science materials have previously been covered by other groups/online resources (Wickham and Grolemund, 2017; Adair et al., 2021; Coursera, 2021), and we therefore provide a high-level overview of these introductory modules below. A more focused description begins with the next training module, which serves as a novel introduction to FAIR data management practices (module 1.5).
