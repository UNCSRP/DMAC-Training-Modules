# Data-Analysis-Training-Modules

The UNC-Superfund Research Program (SRP) seeks to develop new solutions for reducing exposure to inorganic arsenic and prevent arsenic-induced diabetes through mechanistic and translational research.

The Data Analysis and Management Core (DMAC) provide the UNC-Superfund Research Program with critical expertise in bioinformatics, statistics, data management and data integration. Our goal is to support the data management, integration, and analysis needs of the researchers to reveal multi-factorial determinants of inorganic arsenic-induced metabolic dysfunction/diabetes.

This GitHub site has been set up to provide training modules in environmental health data analysis typically performed by analysts within the UNC-SRP.
