#### Introduction to Dose-Response Modeling

#### "The Dose Makes the Poison"

One of the most well-established principles in the field of toxicology is the concept, 
**The Dose Makes the Poison**. Record of this founding principle dates back to the 16th century, when the Swiss physician, Paracelsus, concluded that in sufficient quantities, everything had the potential to cause harm, and the only thing that differentiated something from being harmful or not was the dose. Findings have continued to support the principle that all substances have the potential to cause harm should the dose be sufficient, regardless of the source of an exposure/insult. This concept supports the critical need to evaluate and quantify dose-response relationships.

#### Dose-response Modeling
Dose-response modeling is a method used to quantitatively assess the relationship between an exposure to a chemical (or other stressor) and its related effects. The overall goal of these modeling efforts is to identify which exposure doses are harmful, and which aren't, to human health.

The following summarize the main steps in dose-response modeling:  

**1. Plot data**. Data from relevant epidemiological, clinical, and/or toxicological evaluations are first plotted. Data are plotted in an X-Y plane, where the doses (or concentration) of a chemical (or stressor) are along the x-axis and the response of interests are along the y-axis.

**2. Test various curve fits**. There are many different models that can be used to mathematically describe the relationships between doses and associated responses. Typically, several curve fit models are tested in a dose-response analysis to see which fit the data the best.

**3. Identify the best fitting model curve**. Results from the tested model curve fits are evaluated, and the model(s) which fit the data the best are identified.

**4. Derive values to carry forward in your analyses, based on the best fitting curve model**. Using the best fitting curve model(s), final  benchmark doses (BMDs), benchmark dose lower bounds (BMDLs), and other types of points of departure (PODs) are derived, which then get carried forward in the analysis (e.g., chemical risk assessment).


## Introduction to Training Module
This training module provides an overview on analyzing exposure-associated response/outcome data in relation to exposure concentration (or dose), resulting in the derivation of benchmark doses (BMDs). This topic is of high relevance to the field of environmental health, as BMDS represent values foundational to assessing risk in chemical safety evaluations, and therefore, ultimately dictating the levels at which chemicals are regulated. This module specifically analyzes animal tumor incidence rates in response to exposure to a fictitious chemical (referred to a Chemical Z) tested across 12 different concentrations in drinking water. This dataset was generated for the specific purposes of this exercise, to allow for some interesting curve fits and a comparison between tissue site sensitivity to an example chemical insult.


#### Training Module's **Environmental Health Questions**
This training module was specifically developed to answer the following environmental health questions:

(1) Which target tissue demonstrated the overall highest incidence of tumor formation from any single dose of Chemical Z?
(2) Which target tissue's tumor incidence seems to not be related to dose?
(3) When we generate scatter plots illustrating exposure concentration vs disease outcome, without curves fitted to the data, are we able to derive benchmark doses?
(4) Upon visual inspection of example log-logistic vs. Weibull model curve fits on the intestinal tumor response data, can we confidently determine which of these two models best fits these data?
(5) For the liver tumor response data, which model fits the resulting dose-response curve the best?
(6) For the liver tumor response data, what are the final resulting BMD and BMDL estimates from the best fitting curve model?
(7) In comparing between the intestinal vs liver datasets, which tissue is estimated to show tumor responses at a lower exposure dose?

#### Set your working directory
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
setwd("/filepath to where your input files are")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```


#### Loading the Example Dataset
Let's start by loading the dataset needed for this training module. This dataset is a mock example that was generated for the purposes of this training module, in order to best capture variable types of dose-response relationships and resulting curve fits.

This specific dataset analyzes the relationship between exposure to a fictional chemical, **chemical Z**, in drinking water and tumor incidence in the stomach, intestine (small and/or large), kidney, and liver in mice. These mice were evaluated in a traditional two-year animal bioassay setting. 

*Note that animals are assumed to drink equivalent amounts of water each day for simplicity.*

Loading the data
```{r}
dose_response.data <- read.csv("Module2_1/Module2_1_DoseResponseData.csv")
```


#### Data Viewing

Start with viewing the overall dimensions
```{r}
dim(dose_response.data)
```

Then viewing a list of the column headers
```{r}
colnames(dose_response.data)
```
With this, we can see that data are included for various chemical Z doses (noted in the first column), followed by a column noting the total number of animals tested per dose (in the second column). Then, columns are included describing the number of animals, followed by incidence, of tumor formation across each tissue target of interest (i.e., stomach, intestine, kidney, and liver).


Viewing a quick summary of the values contained within this dataset
```{r}
summary(dose_response.data)
```


<!-- #### With this data summary, we can answer **Environmental Health Question #1**: -->
<!-- #### (1) Which target tissue demonstrated the overall highest incidence of tumor formation from any single dose of Chemical Z? -->
<!-- #### *Answer: The kidney indicates a maximum of 9 animals with tumors developing from a single dose, representing an alarming incidence rate of 90%.* -->

<br>

Alternatively, you can obtain a larger view of dataset using the descibe from Hmisc package
```{r}
Hmisc::describe(dose_response.data)
```


**Overall**, we can see that there are 4 disease outcomes included in this dataset:

+ stomach tumors
+ intestinal tumors
+ kidney tumors
+ liver tumors

All with observed incidences that depend upon the exposure concentration of *Chemical Z*


## Plotting Data in Dose-Response

#### Basic Plotting of Data in Dose-Response
Let's plot each tumor incidence against exposure concentration together in a 2x2 plot.  
Here, the y-axis will range from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating no incidence of tumors and 1 indicating all animals that were tested acquired tumors.

Here, we will use the 'with()' function, which allows us to create a mini-environment using the specified data. We also use the 'par()' function to set graphical parameters, allowing us to create a 2x2 set of plots.
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2));
with(dose_response.data, plot(Incidence_StomachTumor~ChemicalZ_ugperL, ylim=c(0,1)));
with(dose_response.data, plot(Incidence_IntestinalTumor~ChemicalZ_ugperL, ylim=c(0,1)));
with(dose_response.data, plot(Incidence_KidneyTumor~ChemicalZ_ugperL, ylim=c(0,1)));
with(dose_response.data, plot(Incidence_LiverTumor~ChemicalZ_ugperL, ylim=c(0,1)));
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

## Dose-Response Curve Fitting

It is notable that there are many different packages that can be used to fit curves to data. Here, we incorporate the *drc* package to fit several types of potential curve fit models to this example dataset. 

The *drm* function is specifically used from the *drc* package. Common parameters to consider when constructing the curve fit models in *drm* include the following:

**1. Formula**
  
This parameter describes the formula used to fit the data, formatted similar to a standard regression formula line of code. For the purposes of the current training module, this formula will be to fit to describe tumor incidence on chemical exposure concentration, which looks like this in the final code: *Incidence_StomachTumor ~ ChemicalZ_ugperL*

**2. Data**
  
This parameter specifies the dataset you are evaluating. For the current training module, we will be referring to the full dataframe, *dose_response.data*

**3. Weights**
  
This parameter contributes to determining how many observations are used at each dose/concentration, which can inform the model type. For the current training module, the weights in the dataset reflect the total number of animals tested at each exposure concentration.

**4. Function (fct)**
  
This parameter specifies which type of curve fit function you want to implement. Example functions include various types of log-logistic, genaralized log-logistic, weibull, asymptotic regression, and Michaelis-Menten models. Note that *getMeanFunctions()* can be called for the full list of available functions:
```{r}
getMeanFunctions()
```




**5. Type**
  
This parameter specifies the data type of the response (e.g., binomial, continuous, etc). For the current training module, we will select the binomial type of response, which in this package refers to the modeling of data types that are not fully continuous, including this quantile-based incidence rate outcome.


#### First try fitting a log-logistic (LL) model
Because log-logistic (LL) models are commonly used to evaluate dose-response relationships, let's first start by trying to fit a 2 parameter LL function.

Running the model, on the intestinal tumor incidence outcome as an example
```{r}
LL2.model.int <- with(dose_response.data,
                  drm(Incidence_IntestinalTumor~ChemicalZ_ugperL,
                  weights=TotalNoAnimals_Tested, 
                  fct=LL.2(), type="binomial"))
```


It's easy to plot these results using the plot function
```{r}
plot(LL2.model.int, type="all", ylim=c(0,1));
```


#### Let's next try fitting a Weibull model

Running the Weibull curve model, on the intestinal tumor incidence outcome as an example
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
W23.model.int <- with(dose_response.data,
                  drm(Incidence_IntestinalTumor~ChemicalZ_ugperL,
                  weights=TotalNoAnimals_Tested,
                  fct=W2.3(), type="binomial"))
```


Let's plot the results of this function
```{r}
plot(W23.model.int, type="all", ylim=c(0,1));
```


<!-- #### With this, we can now answer **Environmental Health Question #4**: -->
<!-- #### (4) Upon visual inspection of example log-logistic vs. Weibull model curve fits on the intestinal tumor response data, can we confidently determine which of these two models best fits these data? -->
<!-- #### *Answer: No, both of these models appear to fit this dataset to a large extent. A more quantitative approach based on AIC is required to identify the best fitting model (see below).* -->


#### Let's try fitting another model fit based on asymptotic regression modeling

Running the asymptotic regression model, on the intestinal tumor incidence outcome as an example
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
AR2.model.int <- with(dose_response.data,
                  drm(Incidence_IntestinalTumor~ChemicalZ_ugperL,
                  weights=TotalNoAnimals_Tested, 
                  fct=AR.2(), type="binomial"))
```


Let's plot the results of this function
```{r}
plot(AR2.model.int, type="all", ylim=c(0,1));
```




#### Important note on the variety of curve fit models to consider
There are many different types of curve fit models to consider when running your analyses. For example, additional functions are available from other packages, such as the **aomisc package**, which has an associated [Github page](https://github.com/OnofriAndreaPG/aomisc) and [R-bloggers article](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/02/a-collection-of-self-starters-for-nonlinear-regression-in-r/). This package contains a collection of functions that are not included in the current drc pacakage. There are many other options available as well, if you search CRAN, Bioconductor, Github, and general search engines.

## Comparing Curve Fits
Given the variety of models that can be used to fit dose-response data, it is important to consider the results of each model curve fit and identify which model best fits the data.

There are many ways to identify best fitting curves. The most commonly implemented strategies include the following:

**1. Visual Inspection.** Model curve fits can be evaluated visually, to gauge whether or not resulting curves fit the data.

**2. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).** AIC values are commonly used for model selection, and represent an estimator of prediction error and relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data. AIC incorporates the trade-off between a model's goodness of fit and the simplicity, such that it weighs the risk of overfitting vs underfitting. In applications, it is common to choose models with the lowest AIC, pending they describe the data sufficiently.


The AIC function can simply be used here to calculate each resulting model's AIC. Remember, the lower AIC represents the better model curve fit.
```{r}
# Results from the log-logistic model
AIC(LL2.model.int)   

# Results from the Weibull model
AIC(W23.model.int) 

# Results from the asymptotic regression model
AIC(AR2.model.int)   
```
These results demonstrate, quantitatively, that the Weibull model likely describes this dataset the best (out of the evaluated models), since it has the lowest AIC value.


Let's finally produce a summary visualization that display the results of these three model curve fits across this intestinal dataset, with all the curve fits in one plot.
```{r}
# First defining a vector of text to use in the legend, summary of the three curve fits and their AICs
IntestinalCurveFitAICs <- c("Log-Logistic, AIC=30.9", "Weibull, AIC=22.9", "Asymptotic Regression, AIC=40.4")

# Generating the plot
plot(LL2.model.int, type="all", ylim=c(0,1))
# Can add the next models on top of current plot with different line types and weights
plot(W23.model.int, add=TRUE,col="red",lty=4, lwd=1.5)
plot(AR2.model.int, add=TRUE,col="blue",lty=2, lwd=1.5)

# A way to coerce the dots back to black for final view:
plot(LL2.model.int, add=TRUE,col="black")

# Can add a legend as well, specifying the same paramters for linetype (lty) and color (col)
legend(x=1, y=.8, legend=IntestinalCurveFitAICs,
       col=c("black", "red", "blue"), lty=c(1,4,2))
```


## Curve Fitting Example
#### Curve Fitting for Liver Outcomes
For this exercise now focusing on liver tumors, let's quickly fit the same three models and plot the results.

Example log-logistic (LL) model function:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
LL2.model.liver <- with(dose_response.data,
                        drm(Incidence_LiverTumor~ChemicalZ_ugperL,
                        weights=TotalNoAnimals_Tested,
                        fct=LL.2(), type="binomial"))
```

Example Weibull model function:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
W23.model.liver <- with(dose_response.data,
                        drm(Incidence_LiverTumor~ChemicalZ_ugperL,
                        weights=TotalNoAnimals_Tested,
                        fct=W2.3(), type="binomial"))

```


Example asymptotic regression model function:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
AR2.model.liver <- with(dose_response.data,
                  drm(Incidence_LiverTumor~ChemicalZ_ugperL,
                  weights=TotalNoAnimals_Tested, 
                  fct=AR.2(), type="binomial"))
```


Calculating AICs:
```{r}
AIC(LL2.model.liver)
AIC(W23.model.liver)
AIC(AR2.model.liver)
```


Plotting the resulting curve fits:
```{r}
# First defining a vector of text to use in the legend, summary the two curve fits and their AICs
LiverCurveFitAICs <- c("Log-Logistic, AIC=28.1", "Weibull, AIC=24.4", "Asymptotic Regression, AIC=28.8")

# Generating the plot
plot(LL2.model.liver, type="all", ylim=c(0,1))
plot(W23.model.liver, add=TRUE,col="red",lty=3, lwd=1.5)
plot(AR2.model.liver, add=TRUE,col="blue",lty=2, lwd=1.5)

# A way to coerce the dots back to black for final view:
plot(LL2.model.liver, add=TRUE,col="black")

# Can add a legend as well, specifying the same paramters for linetype (lty) and color (col)
legend(x=1, y=.8, legend=LiverCurveFitAICs,
       col=c("black", "red", "blue"), lty=c(1,4,2))
```

<!-- #### (5) For the liver tumor response data, which model fits the resulting dose-response curve the best? -->
<!-- #### *Answer: It is clear from visual inspection of the resulting curve fits and the calculated AIC values that the Weibull model fits the liver tumor response data the best.* -->

## Deriving Benchmark Dose
#### Deriving the Final Benchmark Dose (BMD) Estimates
Using the results from our best fitting models, we can now estimate the resulting benchmark doses (BMDs) to serve as the 'tipping points' of where exposure concentrations are demonstrated to elicit outcomes. A **BMD** is technically defined as a dose or concentration that produces a predetermined change in the response rate of an adverse effect. This predetermined change in response rate is termed the **benchmark response (BMR)**.

In this training module, we implement the *bmd* package to calculate a BMD from the resulting models derived through the drc package (as detailed in the code above).

A typical BMR used in chemical risk assessments for incidence data is 10%, so let's use that here as our example BMR to base the derivation of BMDs off of.

Running the BMD estimate off the Weibull model fit to the liver tumor response data:
```{r}
bmd::bmd(W23.model.liver, bmr = .1, backg = 0)
```
These results indicate that, in order to achieve a change in response rate of 10% (from a background of 0 ug/L), and exposure concentration of 283.7 ug/L is required. Note that a **benchmark dose lower bound (BMDL)** is also provided, indicating the lower bound of the confidence interval surrounding the BMD. BMDL values are also commonly carried forward in risk assessment, since these values are more conservative and thus protective of public health.


<!-- #### With this, we can now answer **Environmental Health Question #6**: -->
<!-- #### (6) For the liver tumor response data, what are the final resulting BMD and BMDL estimates from the best fitting curve model? -->
<!-- #### *Answer: BMD=283.7 and BMDL=192.0 ug/L.* -->

<br>

:::question
<i>With this, we can now answer **Environmental Health Question 6**: </i>
For the liver tumor response data, what are the final resulting BMD and BMDL estimates from the best fitting curve model?
:::
:::answer
**Answer**: BMD=283.7 and BMDL=192.0 ug/L.
:::

<br>

Let's compare these BMD/BMDL estimates to those generated from the best fitting curve fit on the intestinal tumor response data:
```{r}
bmd::bmd(W23.model.int, bmr = .1, backg = 0)
```



<!-- #### With this, we can now answer **Environmental Health Question #7**: -->
<!-- #### (7) In comparing between the intestinal vs liver datasets, which tissue is estimated to show tumor responses at a lower exposure dose? -->
<!-- #### *Answer: The liver demonstrates tumor responses at a lower exposure dose, since the intestinal BMD is 409.3 which is much higher than the liver BMD of 283.7 ug/L.* -->

## Concluding Remarks
In conclusion, this training module provides several examples of methods to fit model curves to dose-response data that are typically evaluated in environmental health assessments. These examples highlight the importance of evaluating model fit to ultimately determine which model should be used to derive final BMD and BMDL estimates. Through this training module, example methods and associated script are designed with flexibility to aid in future analyses in which researchers may aim to analyze in vitro bioactivity, in vivo apical outcomes, and human health outcomes in the context of dose-response.

##### How do we even begin to analyze such data?  

For diverse, high-dimensional data, new approaches are needed. Traditional statistics may be able to handle 1:1 or 1:many comparisons of singular quantities (e.g. activity concentrations (e.g., AC50s for two chemicals). However, once the modeling needs become overly complex (or exploratory), assumptions of most traditional methods will be violated.   

#### Defining predictive modeling in the context of toxicology and environmental health

We often think of predictions as having a forward-time component (*i.e. What will happen next?*). What about "prediction" in a different sense as applied to toxicology? 

**Working definition**: **Predictive toxicology** describes a multidisciplinary approach to chemical toxicity evaluation that more efficiently uses animal test results, when needed, and leverages expanding non-animal test methods to forecast the effects of a chemical on biological systems
  
  - eg 1. Can I more efficiently design animal studies and analyze data from shorter assays using less animals to predict long-term health outcomes?
  
  - eg 2. Can this suite of in vitro assays <b>predict</b> what would happen in an organism?
  
  - eg 3. Can I use diverse, high-dimensional data to cluster chemicals into **predicted** activity classes?

</left>   
  
Similar logic applies to the field of exposure science. What about "prediction" applied to exposure science?

**Working definition**: **Predictive exposure science** describes a multidisciplinary approach to chemical exposure evaluations that more efficiently uses biomonitoring, chemical inventory, and other exposure science-relevant databases to forecast exposure rates in target populations.

  - eg 1. Can I use existing biomonitoring data from NHANES to predict exposure rates for chemicals that have yet to be measured in target populations? (see ExpoCast program, eg. [Wambaugh et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25343693/))

  - eg 2. Can I use chemical product use inventory data to predict the likelihood of a chemical being present in a certain consumer product (eg. [Phillips et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29405058/))



#### Distinguish between machine learning (ML) and traditional statistical methods

There is *plenty* of debate as to where the line(s) between ML and traditional statistics should be drawn. A perfect delineation is not necessary for our purposes. Rather, we will focus on the usual goals/intent of each to help us understand the distinction for Environmental Health Research.

**Working distinction**: Statistics draws population inferences from a sample, and machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns. [https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4642]

Thus, by our working definition of predictive toxicology, we are interested in predictive aspects of ML that can give us generalizable forecasts as to effects of chemicals on biological systems.

The image below shows graphical abstractions of how a "problem" is solved using either traditional statistics in the top row of (A) logistic and (B) linear regression or ML in the bottom row of (C) support vector machines,  (D) artificial neural networks, and (E) decision trees.

The list of ML methods is continually expanding and subject to new taxonomic [description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#Dimensionality_reduction). 

There are many different types of ML methods that we can employ, depending on the data type / purpose of data analysis. Generally speaking, ML is considered to encompass the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence (AI). A recent [review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34029068/) written together with [Erin Baker's lab](https://bakerlab.wordpress.ncsu.edu/) provides a high-level overview on some of the types of ML methods and challenges to address when analyzing multi-omic data (including chemical signature data).


**K-Means Clustering**

A common type of ML method that will be included in the scripted activity is called **k-means clustering**. 
K-means is a common clustering algorithm used to partition quantitative data. This algorithm works by first, randomly selecting a pre-specified number of clusters, k, across the data space, with each cluster having a data centroid. When using a standard Euclidean distance metric, the distance is calculated from an observation to each centroid, then the observation is assigned to the cluster of the closest centroid. After all observations have been assigned to one of the k clusters, the average of all observations in a cluster is calculated, and the centroid for the cluster is moved to the location of the mean. The process then repeats, with the distance computed between the observations and the updated centroids. Observations may be reassigned to the same cluster, or moved to a different cluster if it is closer to another centroid. These iterations continue until there are no longer changes between cluster assignments for observations, resulting in the final cluster assignments that are then carried forward for analysis/interpretation.

Helpful resources on k-means clustering include the following: [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print12_toc.pdf) &
[Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/k-means-clustering-algorithm-applications-evaluation-methods-and-drawbacks-aa03e644b48a)



**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

Another very common ML method you can use to look at big data is a method to reduce high-dimensional data called **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. This can be defined in many ways, though here are some of the important elements that underly a PCA: 

1. PCA partitions variance in a dataset into linearly uncorrelated principal components (PCs), which are weighted combinations of the original features. 

2. Each PC (starting from PC1) summarizes a decreasing % of variance.

3. Every instance (e.g. chemical) in the original dataset has a "score" on each PC.

4. Any combination of PCs can be compared to summarize relationships amongst the instances (e.g. chemicals).





## Introduction to Training Module
In this activity we are going to analyze an example dataset of physicochemical property information for chemicals spanning **per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and statins**. PFAS represent a ubiquitous and pervasive class of man-made industrial chemicals that are commonly used in food packaging, commercial household products such as Teflon, cleaning products, and flame retardants. PFAS are recognized as highly stable compounds that, upon entering the environment, can persist for many years and act as harmful sources of exposure. Statins represent a class of lipid-lowering compounds that are commonly used as pharmaceutical treatments for patients at risk of cardiovascular disease. Because of their common use amongst patients, statins can also end up in water and wastewater effluent, making them of environmental relevance as well.

This training module was designed to evaluate the chemical space of these diverse compounds, and to illustrate the utility of machine learning methods to differentiate chemical class and predict chemical groupings that can inform a variety of environmental and toxicological applications. The two types of machine learning methods that will be employed are k-means and PCA (as described in the introduction).


#### Training Module's **Environmental Health Questions**
This training module was specifically developed to answer the following environmental health questions:

(1) Can we differentiate between PFAS and statin chemical classes, when considering just the raw physicochemical property variables without applying machine learning techniques?
(2) What are some of the physicochemical properties that seem to be driving chemical clustering patterns derived through k-means?
(3) Upon reducing the data through PCA, which physicochemical property contributes the most towards informing data variance captured in the primary principal component (Comp.1)?
(4) How do the data compare when physicochemical properties are reduced using PCA?
(5) If we did not have information telling us which chemical belonged to which class, could we use PCA and k-means to accurately predict whether a chemical is a PFAS vs statin?
(6) What kinds of applications/endpoints can be better understood and/or predicted, because of these derived chemical groupings?

```


#### Loading the Example Dataset
Let's start by loading the datasets needed for this training module. We are going to use a dataset of substances that have a diverse chemical space of PFAS and statin compounds. This list of chemicals will be uploaded alongside physicochemical property data. The chemical lists for 'PFAS' and 'Statins' were obtained from the EPA's Computational Toxicology Dashboard [Chemical Lists](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical-lists). The physicochemical properties were obtained by uploading these lists into the National Toxoicology Program’s [Integrated Chemical Environment (ICE)](https://ice.ntp.niehs.nih.gov/). 
```{r}
dat <- read.csv("Module2_2/Module2_2_Chemical_Lists_PFAS-Statins.csv", 
                fileEncoding="UTF-8-BOM")
```


#### Data Viewing

Let's first view the substances dataset, starting with the overall dimensions:
```{r}
dim(dat)
```

Then looking at the first four rows and five columns of data:
```{r}
  dat[1:4,1:5]
```

Note that the first column, 'List', designates the following two larger chemical classes:
```{r}
unique(dat$List)
```


Let's lastly view all of the column headers:
```{r}
colnames(dat)
```

In the data file, the first four columns represent chemical identifier information. All remaining columns represent different physicochemical properties derived from OPERA via [Integrated Chemical Environment (ICE)](https://ice.ntp.niehs.nih.gov/). Because the original titles of these physicochemical properties contained commas and spaces, R automatically coverted these into periods. Hence, titles like "OPERA..Boiling.Point"


<!-- #### Subset to only one chemical identifier (rownames) + data columns (x) -->

For ease of downstream data analyses, let's create a more focused dataframe option containing only one chemical identifier (CASRN) as row names, and then just the physicochemical property columns.
```{r}
dat.x <- dat[,5:ncol(dat)]
rownames(dat.x) <- dat$CASRN
```

Now we can explore this data subset.
```{r}
# Overall dimensions
dim(dat.x) 
# Viewing the first four rows and five columns
dat.x[1:4,1:5] 
colnames(dat.x)
```


<!-- #### Evaluating the Original Physicochemical Property Data across Substances -->
Let's first see how these chemicals group when using the 'real' physicochemical property data, without any fancy data reduction or other machine learning techniques. We can plot chemicals along the first two 'real' properties, with molecular weight as one axis and boiling point as the other.

Here we can create a plot using basic ggplot functions, coloring by the chemical classes from the 'List' column of the original dataframe.
```{r}
ggplot(as.data.frame(dat.x[,1:2]), aes(x=Molecular.Weight, y=OPERA..Boiling.Point, 
                                       color=as.factor(dat$List))) + 
  geom_point(size=4) + theme_bw() + 
  ggtitle('Version A: Bivariate Plot of Two Original Physchem Variables') + 
  xlab("Molecular Weight") + ylab("Boiling Point")
```


Now we can plot chemicals along the next two sets of 'real' property data, with Henry's Law constant as one axis and melting point as the other.

Here we can create a plot using basic ggplot functions, coloring by the chemical classes from the 'List' column of the original dataframe.
```{r}
ggplot(as.data.frame(dat.x[,3:4]), aes(x=OPERA..Henry.s.Law.Constant, 
                                       y=OPERA..Melting.Point, 
                                       color=as.factor(dat$List))) + 
  geom_point(size=4) + theme_bw() + 
  ggtitle('Version B: Bivariate Plot of Two Other Original Physchem Variables') + 
  xlab("OPERA..Henry.s.Law.Constant") + ylab("OPERA..Melting.Point")
```

These plots provide two examples illustrating part of the distribution of physicochemical property data across the two classes of chemicals, spanning PFAS and statins.

<!-- #### (1) Can we differentiate between PFAS and statin chemical classes, when considering just the raw physicochemical property variables without applying machine learning techniques? -->
<!-- #### *Answer: Only in part. From the first plot, we can see that PFAS tend to have lower molecular weight ranges in comparison to the statins, though other property variables clearly overlap in ranges of values, making the groupings not entirely clear.* -->

## K-means Analysis

#### Identifying Clusters of Chemicals through k-means

Let's derive clusters of chemicals, based on ALL underlying physicochemical property data, using k-means clustering.
For this example, let's coerce the k-means algorithms to calculate n=2 distinct clusters (based on their corresponding mean centered values). Here we choose to derive two distinct clusters, because we are ultimately going to see if we can use this information to predict each chemical's classification into two distinct chemical classes (i.e., PFAS vs statins). Note that we can derive more clusters using similar code, depending on the question being addressed.

We can give a name to this variable, to easily provide the number of clusters in the next lines of code, 'num.centers':
```{r}
num.centers <- 2
```


#### Estimate k-means Clusters
Here we derive chemical clusters using k-means:
```{r}
clusters <- kmeans(dat.x,                  # input dataframe
                   centers = num.centers,  # number of cluster centers to calculate
                   iter.max = 1000,        # the maximum number of iterations allowed
                   
                   nstart = 50)            # the number of rows used as the random 
                                           # set for the initial centers 
                                           # (during the first iteration)
```

The resulting property values that were derived as the final cluster centers can be pulled using:
```{r}
clusters$centers
```


#### Visualize k-means Clusters
Let's add the cluster assignments to the physicochemical data and create a new dataframe, which can then be used in a heat map visualization to see how these physicochemical data distributions clustered according to k-means.

These cluster assignments can be pulled from the 'cluster' list output, selecting the 'cluster' list, where chemicals are designated to each cluster with either a 1 or 2. You can view these using:
```{r}
clusters$cluster
```


Because these results are listed in the exact same order as the inputted dataframe, we can simply bind these assignments to the dat.x dataframe using cbind().
```{r}
dat_wclusters <- as.data.frame(cbind(dat.x,clusters$cluster))

# Renaming this new column "kmeans_cluster"
colnames(dat_wclusters)[11] <- "kmeans_cluster"  

# Sorting data by cluster assignments
dat_wclusters <- dat_wclusters[order(dat_wclusters$kmeans_cluster),]  
```


#### Heat Map Visualizations
To generate a heat map, we need to first create a separate dataframe for the cluster assignments, ordered in the same way as the physicochemical data:
```{r}
# Creating the dataframe
hm_cluster <- data.frame(dat_wclusters$kmeans_cluster, 
                         row.names=row.names(dat_wclusters))  

# Reassigning the column name
colnames(hm_cluster) <- "kmeans_cluster"   

# Coercing the cluster numbers into factor variables, to make the heat map prettier
hm_cluster$kmeans_cluster <- as.factor(hm_cluster$kmeans_cluster) 

# Viewing this new cluster assignment dataframe
head(hm_cluster)  
```

Then we can call this dataframe, as well as the main physicochemical property dataframe (both sorted by clusters) into the following heat map visualization code, leveraging the pheatmap function.
```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
chem_hm <- pheatmap(dat_wclusters[,1:10], 
                    main="Heat Map of Physicochemical Properties with k-means Cluster Assignments",
                    cluster_rows=FALSE, cluster_cols = FALSE, # no further clustering, for simplicity
                    scale="column",              # scaling the data to make differences across chemicals more apparent
                    annotation_row = hm_cluster, # calling the cluster assignment dataframe as a separate color bar
                    angle_col = 45, fontsize_col = 7, fontsize_row = 3, # adjusting size and orientation of labels on axes
                    cellheight = 3, cellwidth = 25, # setting height and width for cells
                    border_color = FALSE # specify no border surrounding the cells
)
```


Shown here is a heat map displaying the relative values for each physicochemical property, with all 10 properties listed along the bottom. Individual chemicals are listed along the right hand side. The k-means cluster assignment is provided as a separate color bar on the left.

## Principal Component Analysis 
Next, we will run through some example analyses applying the common data reduction technique of PCA.

We can calculate the principal components across ALL physicochemical data across all chemicals using the princomp function.
```{r}
my.pca <- princomp(dat.x,   # input dataframe of physchem data
                   cor = T) # calculations will be based on the correlation matrix 
                            # (as opposed to covariance) since we have all numeric 
                            # values here (default PCA option)
```


Here are the resulting scores for each chemical's contribution towards each principal component (shown here as components 1-10).
```{r}
head(my.pca$scores)
```

And the resulting loading factors of each property's contribution towards each principal component.
```{r}
head(my.pca$loadings)

my.pca$loadings
```


<!-- #### With these results, we can answer **Environmental Health Question #3**: -->
<!-- #### (3) Upon reducing the data through PCA, which physicochemical property contributes the most towards informing data variance captured in the primary principal component (Comp.1)? -->
<!-- #### *Answer: Boiling point contributes the most towards principal component #1.* -->
<br>

:::question

Upon reducing the data through PCA, which physicochemical property contributes the most towards informing data variance captured in the primary principal component (Comp.1)?
:::
:::answer
**Answer**: Boiling point contributes the most towards principal component #1.
:::

<br>


#### Variance Captured by each Principal Component

We can view summary statistics describing how much of the variance from the original dataset was captured by each component, using the summary function.
```{r}
summary(my.pca)
```

We can also calculate these values, and pull them into a dataframe for future use.

For example, to pull the percentage of variance explained by each principal component, we can run the following calculations, where first eigenvalues (eigs) are calculated and then used to calculate percent of variance, per principal component:
```{r}
eigs <- my.pca$sdev^2
Comp.stats <- data.frame(eigs, eigs/sum(eigs), row.names=names(eigs))
colnames(Comp.stats) <- c("Eigen_Values", "Percent_of_Variance")
head(Comp.stats)
```
Here, we can see that Principal Component #1 (Comp.1) captures ~41% of the variance across all physicochemical property values, across all chemicals. Principal Component #2 captures ~24%, etc.



#### Visualizing PCA Results

Let's now view the results of this PCA, focusing on the first two principal components, and coloring each chemical according to class (i.e. PFAS vs statins).
```{r}
ggplot(as.data.frame(my.pca$scores), aes(x=Comp.1, y=Comp.2, color=as.factor(dat$List))) + 
  geom_point(size=4) + theme_bw() + 
  ggtitle('Version C: PCA Plot of the First 2 PCs, colored by Chemical Class') + 
  xlab("Principal Component 1") + ylab("Principal Component 2")
```


<!-- #### With this, we can answer **Environmental Health Question #4**: -->
<!-- #### (4) How do the data compare when physicochemical properties are reduced using PCA? -->
<!-- #### *Answer: Data become more compressed, and variables reduce across principal components capturing the majority of variance. This results in improved data visualizations, where all dimensions of the physiochemical dataset are compressed and captured across the displayed components.* -->

## Combining K-Means with PCA

#### Incorporating K-Means into PCA for Predictive Modeling
We can also identify cluster-based trends within data that are reduced, after running PCA. This example analysis does so, expanding upon the previously generated PCA results.


#### Estimate k-means clusters from PCA results

Let's first run script, similar to the previous k-means analysis and associated parameters, though instead here we will use data reduced values from the PCA analysis. Specifically, clusters across PCA "scores" values will be derived, where scores represent the relative amount each chemical contributed to each principal component.

```{r}
clusters_PCA <- kmeans(my.pca$scores, centers = num.centers, iter.max = 1000, nstart = 50)
```


The resulting PCA score values that were derived as the final cluster centers can be pulled using:
```{r}
clusters_PCA$centers
```


Viewing the final cluster assignment, per chemical:
```{r}
head(cbind(rownames(dat.x),clusters_PCA$cluster))
```  



#### Visualizing k-means clusters from PCA results

Let's now view, again, the results of the main PCA, focusing on the first two principal components; though this time let's color each chemical according to k-means cluster.
```{r}
ggplot(as.data.frame(my.pca$scores), aes(x=Comp.1, y=Comp.2, 
                                         color=as.factor(clusters_PCA$cluster))) + 
  geom_point(size=4) + theme_bw() + 
  ggtitle('Version D: PCA Plot of the First 2 PCs, colored by k-means Clustering') + 
  xlab("Principal Component 1") + ylab("Principal Component 2")
```


<!-- #### With this, we can answer **Environmental Health Question #5**: -->
<!-- #### (5) If we did not have information telling us which chemical belonged to which class, could we use PCA and k-means to accurately predict whether a chemical is a PFAS vs statin? -->

## Concluding Remarks
In conclusion, this training module provide an example exercise on organizing physicochemical data, and analyzing trends within these data to determine chemical groupings. Results are compared from those produced using just the original data vs. clustered data from k-means vs. reduced data from PCA. K-means is then used in combination with PCA approaches to showcase the power of these machine learning methods, where the classes of each chemical were able to be predicted with high levels of accuracy. These methods represent common tools that are used in high dimensional data analyses within the field of environmental health sciences.

<!-- #### Introduction to Mixtures Toxicology and *In Silico* Modeling to Address Mixtures -->
#### Introduction to Mixtures Toxicology
Humans are rarely, if ever, exposed to single chemicals at a time. Instead, humans are often exposed to multiple stressors in their everyday environments in the form of mixtures. These stressors can include environmental chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and they can also include other types of stressors such as socioeconomic factors and other attributes that can place individuals at increased risk of acquiring disease. Because it is not possible to test every possible combination of exposure that an individual might experience in their lifetime, approaches that take into account variable and complex exposure conditions through mixtures modeling are needed.

Some helpful resources that provide further background on the topic of mixtures toxicology and mixtures modeling include the following:

**Computational Approaches to Address Mixtures**  
There are different computational approaches that can be implemented to address this research topic. This training module focuses on a method called **Sufficient Similarity** to determine which groups of exposure conditions are chemically/biologically similar enough to be regulated for safety together, based on the same set of regulatory criteria. Computational approaches that can be used for exposure groupings include principal component analysis and clustering, to elucidate patterns among high-dimensional data. More example publications that have used this approach to address environmental health questions are detailed at the bottom of this training module.

Another approach that is commonly used when evaluating mixtures is called **Relative Potency Factors**. This is also known as a component-based approach. Component-based approaches use data from individual chemicals (components of the mixture) and additivity models to estimate the effects of the mixture.  

There are many methods that can be leveraged to also elucidate relationships between individual chemicals/chemical groups in complex mixtures and their resulting toxicity/health effects. As an example, we recently published an environmentally relevant example that implemented **quantile g-computation** statistics to identify chemicals present in wildfire smoke emissions that impact toxicity. This example study was published in the following:

## Introduction to Training Module
This module serves as an example mixtures analysis characterizing the nutritional supplement, *Ginkgo biloba*.

*Ginkgo biloba* represents a popular type of botanical supplement currently on the market. People take *Ginkgo biloba* to improve brain function, but there is conflicting data on its efficacy. Like other botanicals, *Ginkgo biloba* is a complex mixture with 100s-1000s of constituents. Here, the variability in chemical and toxicological profiles across samples of *Ginkgo biloba* purchased from different commercial sources is evaluated. We can use data from a well-characterized sample (reference sample) to evaluate the safety of other samples that are ‘sufficiently similar’ to the reference sample. Samples that are different (i.e., do not meet the standards of sufficient similarity) from the reference sample would require additional safety data.

A total of 29 *Ginkgo biloba* extract samples were analyzed. These samples are abbreviated as “GbE_” followed by a unique sample identifier (GbE = *Ginkgo biloba* Extract). These data have been previously published:

+ Catlin NR, Collins BJ, Auerbach SS, Ferguson SS, Harnly JM, Gennings C, Waidyanatha S, Rice GE, Smith-Roe SL, Witt KL, Rider CV. How similar is similar enough? A sufficient similarity case study with Ginkgo biloba extract. Food Chem Toxicol. 2018 Aug;118:328-339. PMID: [29752982](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29752982/).

+ Collins BJ, Kerns SP, Aillon K, Mueller G, Rider CV, DeRose EF, London RE, Harnly JM, Waidyanatha S. Comparison of phytochemical composition of Ginkgo biloba extracts using a combination of non-targeted and targeted analytical approaches. Anal Bioanal Chem. 2020 Oct;412(25):6789-6809. PMID: [32865633](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32865633/).


#### *Ginkgo biloba* chemistry dataset background
The chemical profiles of these sample extracts were first analyzed using targeted mass spectrometry-based approaches. The concentrations of 12 *Ginkgo biloba* marker compounds were measured in units of mean weight as a ratio [g chemical / g sample]. Note that in this dataset, non-detects have been replaced with values of zero for simplicity; though there are more advanced methods to impute values for non-detects. Script is provided to evaluate how *Ginkgo biloba* extracts group together, based on chemical profiles.

#### *Ginkgo biloba* toxicity dataset background
The toxicological profiles of these samples were also analyzed using *in vitro* test methods. These data represent area under the curve (AUC) values indicating changes in gene expression across various concentrations of the *Ginkgo biloba* extract samples. Positive AUC values indicate a gene that was collectively increased in expression as concentration increased, and a negative AUC value indicates a gene that was collectively decreased in expression as exposure concentration increased. Script is provided to evaluate how *Ginkgo biloba* extracts group together, based on toxicity profiles.


#### Training Module's **Environmental Health Questions**
This training module was specifically developed to answer the following environmental health questions:

(1) Based on the chemical analysis, which *Ginkgo biloba* extract looks the most different?
(2) When viewing the variability between chemical profiles, how many groupings of potentially ‘sufficiently similar’ *Ginkgo biloba* samples do you see?
(3) Based on the chemical analysis, which chemicals do you think are important in differentiating between the different *Ginkgo biloba* samples?
(4) After removing two samples that have the most different chemical profiles (and are thus, potential outliers), do we obtain similar chemical groupings?
(5) When viewing the variability between toxicity profiles, how many groupings of potentially ‘sufficiently similar’ *Ginkgo biloba* samples do you see?
(6) Based on the toxicity analysis, which genes do you think are important in differentiating between the different *Ginkgo biloba* samples?
(7) Were similar chemical groups identified when looking at just the chemistry vs. just the toxicity? How could this impact regulatory decisions, if we only had one of these datasets?


#### Script Preparations

#### Cleaning the global environment
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
```

#### Installing required R packages
If you already have these packages installed, you can skip this step, or you can run the below code which checks installation status for you.
```{r, results=FALSE, message=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("tidyverse"))
  install.packages("tidyverse");

if (!requireNamespace("readxl"))
  install.packages("readxl");

if (!requireNamespace("factoextra"))
  install.packages("factoextra");

if (!requireNamespace("pheatmap"))
  install.packages("pheatmap");

if (!requireNamespace("gridExtra"))
  install.packages("gridExtra");

if (!requireNamespace("ggplotify"))
  install.packages("ggplotify")
```


#### Loading R packages

```


#### Loading the Example *Ginkgo biloba* Datasets

We need to first read in the chemistry and toxicity data from the provided excel file. Here, data were originally organized such that the actual observations start on row 2 (dataset descriptions were in the first row). So let's implement skip=1, which skips reading in the first row.
```{r}

# Loads the chemistry data tab
chem <- read_xlsx("Module2_3/Module2_3_SufficientSimilarity_Data.xlsx" , 
                  sheet = "chemistry data", skip=1) 

# Loads the toxicity data tab
tox  <- read_xlsx("Module2_3/Module2_3_SufficientSimilarity_Data.xlsx" , 
                  sheet = "in vitro data", skip=1) 
```


#### Data Viewing

Let's first see how many rows and columns of data are present in both datasets.
```{r}
dim(chem)
```
The chemistry dataset contains information on 29 samples (rows); and 1 sample identifier + 12 chemicals (total of 13 columns)

```{r}
dim(tox)
```
The tox dataset contains information on 29 samples (rows); and 1 sample identifier + 5 genes (total of 6 columns)


Let's also see what kind of data are organized within the datasets.
```{r}
colnames(chem)
```

```{r}
head(chem)
```

```{r}
colnames(tox)
```

```{r}
head(tox)
```



<!-- ## Chemistry-based Sufficient Similarity Analysis -->
## Chemistry-based Approach
The first method employed in this Sufficient Similarity analysis is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a very common dimensionality reduction technique, as detailed in the 'Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling' training module.

In summary, PCA finds dimensions (eigenvectors) in the higher dimensional original data that capture as much of the variation as possible, which you can then plot. This allows you to project higher dimensional data, in this case 12 dimensions (representing 12 measured chemicals), in fewer dimensions (we'll use 2). These dimensions, or components, capture the "essence" of the original dataset.

Before we can run PCA on this chemistry dataset, we first need to scale the data across samples.
We do this here for the chemistry dataset, because we specifically want to evaluate and potentially highlight/emphasize chemicals that may be at relatively low abundance. These low-abundance chemicals may actually be contaminants that drive toxicological effects.

Let's first re-save the original chemistry dataset to compare off of:
```{r}
chem_original <- chem
```

We also can make a scaled version to carry forward in this analysis. Here, we move the sample column the row names then scale and center data:
```{r}
chem <- chem %>% column_to_rownames("Sample")
chem <- as.data.frame(scale(as.matrix(chem)))
```

Let's now compare one of the rows of data (here, sample GbE_E) to see what scaling did:
```{r}
chem_original[5,]
chem[5,]
```


You can see that scaling made the concentrations distributed across each chemical center around 0. Now, we can run PCA on the scaled data:
```{r}
chem_pca <- princomp(chem)
```

Looking at the scree plot, we see the first two principal components capture most of the variance in the data (~64%).
```{r}
fviz_eig(chem_pca)
```


Here are the resulting PCA scores for each sample, for each principal component (shown here as components 1-12).
```{r}
head(chem_pca$scores)
```

And the resulting loading factors of each chemical's contribution towards each principal component. Results are arranged by a chemical's contribution to PC1, the component accounting for most of the variation in the data.
```{r}
head(chem_pca$loadings)

# Pulling the chemical-specific loadings into a separate matrix
loadings <- as.data.frame.matrix(chem_pca$loadings)  

# Sorting the loadings from highest to lowest for component #1
loadings %>% arrange(desc(Comp.1))  
```
These resulting loading factors allow us to identify which constituents (of the 12 total) contribute to the principal components explaining data variabilities. For instance, we can see here that:  
**Quercetin** is listed at the top, with the largest loading value for principal component 1. Thus, Quercetin represents the constituents that contributes to the overall variability in the dataset to the greatest extent.  
The next three chemicals are all **Ginkgolide** constituents, followed by **Bilobalide** and **Kaempferol**, and so forth.


If we look at principal component 2, we can now see a different set of chemicals contributing to the variability captured in this component:
```{r}
# Sorting the loadings from highest to lowest for component #2
loadings %>% arrange(desc(Comp.2))  
```
With **Ginkgolic Acids** listed first here.


#### Visualizing Samples by PCs

We can also visualize sample groupings based on these principal components 1 & 2. To view the PCA plot:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
# First pull the percent variation captured by each component
pca_percent <- round(100*chem_pca$sdev^2/sum(chem_pca$sdev^2),1)

# Then make a dataframe for the PCA plot generation script using first three components
pca_df <- data.frame(PC1 = chem_pca$scores[,1], PC2 = chem_pca$scores[,2])

# Plot this dataframe
chem_pca_plt <- ggplot(pca_df, aes(PC1,PC2))+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, size=0.3)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, size=0.3)+
  geom_point(size=3, color="deepskyblue3") +
  geom_text(aes(label=rownames(pca_df)), fontface="bold", 
            position=position_jitter(width=0.4,height=0.4))+
  labs(x=paste0("PC1 (",pca_percent[1],"%)"), y=paste0("PC2 (",pca_percent[2],"%)"))+
  ggtitle("GbE Sample PCA by Chemistry Profiles")


# Changing the colors of the titles and axis text
chem_pca_plt <- chem_pca_plt + theme(plot.title=element_text(color="deepskyblue3", face="bold"),
                    axis.title.x=element_text(color="deepskyblue3", face="bold"),
                    axis.title.y=element_text(color="deepskyblue3", face="bold"))

# Viewing this resulting plot
chem_pca_plt
```

This plot tells us a lot about sample groupings based on chemical profiles!

#### Heat Map of the Mixtures Chemistry Data
As an alternative way of viewing the chemical profile data, we can make a heat map of the scaled chemistry data.

We concurrently run hierarchical clustering that shows us how closely samples are related to each other, based on different algorithms than data reduction-based PCA. Samples that fall on nearby branches are more similar. Samples that don't share branches with many/any others are often considered outliers.

By default, pheatmap uses a Euclidean distance to cluster the observations, which is a very common clustering algorithm. For more details, see the following description of [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance).
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
chem_hm <- pheatmap(chem, main="GbE Sample Heat Map by Chemistry Profiles",
                    cluster_rows=TRUE, cluster_cols = FALSE,
                    angle_col = 45, fontsize_col = 7, treeheight_row = 60)
```

This plot tells us a lot about the individual chemicals that differentiate the sample groupings

Let's now revisit the PCA plot.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
chem_pca_plt
```

GbE_G and GbE_N look so different from the rest of the samples, they could be outliers and potentially influencing overall data trends. Let's make sure that, if we remove these two samples, our sample groupings still look the same.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
chem_filt <- chem %>%
  rownames_to_column("Sample") %>%
  filter(!Sample %in% c("GbE_G","GbE_N")) %>%
  column_to_rownames("Sample")
```

Now lets re-run PCA and generate a heat map on the chemical data with these outlier samples removed.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
chem_filt_pca <- princomp(chem_filt)

# Get the percent variation captured by each component
pca_percent_filt <- round(100*chem_filt_pca$sdev^2/sum(chem_filt_pca$sdev^2),1)

# Make dataframe for PCA plot generation using first three components
pca_df_filt <- data.frame(PC1 = chem_filt_pca$scores[,1], PC2 = chem_filt_pca$scores[,2])

# Plot this dataframe
chem_filt_pca_plt <- ggplot(pca_df_filt, aes(PC1,PC2))+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, size=0.3)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, size=0.3)+
  geom_point(size=3, color="aquamarine2") +
  geom_text(aes(label=rownames(pca_df_filt)), fontface="bold", 
            position=position_jitter(width=0.5,height=0.5))+
  labs(x=paste0("PC1 (",pca_percent[1],"%)"), y=paste0("PC2 (",pca_percent[2],"%)"))+
  ggtitle("GbE Sample PCA by Chemistry Profiles excluding Potential Outliers")

# Changing the colors of the titles and axis text
chem_filt_pca_plt <- chem_filt_pca_plt + 
  theme(plot.title=element_text(color="aquamarine2", face="bold"),
                    axis.title.x=element_text(color="aquamarine2", face="bold"),
                    axis.title.y=element_text(color="aquamarine2", face="bold"))

# Viewing this resulting plot
chem_filt_pca_plt
```


We can view the full samples vs filtered samples chemistry PCA plots together.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=9, fig.width=8}
grid.arrange(chem_pca_plt, chem_filt_pca_plt)
```

<!-- ## Toxicity-based Sufficient Similarity Analysis -->
## Toxicity-based Approach

The first method employed in this Sufficient Similarity analysis is, again, Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Unlike the chemistry dataset, we can use the toxicity dataset as is without scaling. The reason we want to analyze the raw data is because we want to emphasize genes that are showing a large response. Similarly, we want to demphasize genes that are not doing much in response to the exposure condition. If we scale these data, we will reduce this needed variability.

So here, we first move the sample column to row names:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
tox <- tox %>% column_to_rownames("Sample")
```

Then, we can run PCA on this tox dataframe:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
tox_pca <- princomp(tox)
```

Looking at the scree plot, we see the first two principal components capture most of the variation (~93%):
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
fviz_eig(tox_pca)
```

Plot the samples by principal components:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=6}
# Get the percent variation captured by each component
pca_percent <- round(100*tox_pca$sdev^2/sum(tox_pca$sdev^2),1)

# Make dataframe for PCA plot generation using first three components
tox_pca_df <- data.frame(PC1 = tox_pca$scores[,1], PC2 = tox_pca$scores[,2])

# Plot the first two components
tox_pca_plt <- ggplot(tox_pca_df, aes(PC1,PC2))+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, size=0.3)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, size=0.3)+
  geom_point(size=3, color="deeppink3") +
  geom_text(aes(label=rownames(pca_df)), fontface="bold", 
            position=position_jitter(width=0.25,height=0.25))+
  labs(x=paste0("PC1 (",pca_percent[1],"%)"), y=paste0("PC2 (",pca_percent[2],"%)"))+
  ggtitle("GbE Sample PCA by Toxicity Profiles")

# Changing the colors of the titles and axis text
tox_pca_plt <- tox_pca_plt + theme(plot.title=element_text(color="deeppink3", face="bold"),
                    axis.title.x=element_text(color="deeppink3", face="bold"),
                    axis.title.y=element_text(color="deeppink3", face="bold"))

Based on the toxicity analysis, which genes do you think are important in differentiating between the different *Ginkgo biloba* samples?
:::
:::answer
**Answer**:  It looks like the CYP enzyme genes, particularly CYP2B6, are highly up-regulated in response to several of these sample exposures, and thus dictate a lot of these groupings.

## Comparing Results 

#### Chemistry vs. Toxicity Sufficient Similarity Analyses

Let's view the PCA plots for both datasets together, side-by-side:
```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=11}
pca_compare <- grid.arrange(chem_pca_plt,tox_pca_plt, nrow=1)
```

Let's also view the PCA plots for both datasets together, top-to-bottom, to visualize the trends along both axes better between these two views.
```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
pca_compare <- grid.arrange(chem_pca_plt,tox_pca_plt)
```


We can also visual representation of some of the major grouping similarities vs differences. Here is an edited version of the above figures, highlighting with colored circles some chemical groups of interest identified through chemistry vs toxicity-based sufficient similarity analyses:

<!-- #### These plots can help us answer **Environmental Health Question 7**: -->

#### The Field of "-Omics"
The field of "-omics" has rapidly evolved since its inception in the mid-1990’s, initiated from information obtained through sequencing of the human genome (see the [Human Genome Project](https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project)) as well as the advent of high-content technologies. High-content technologies have allowed the rapid and economical assessment of genome-wide, or ‘omics’-based, endpoints.

Traditional molecular biology techniques typically evaluate the function(s) of individual genes and gene products. Omics-based methods, on the other hand, utilize non-targeted methods to identify many to all genes or gene products in a given environmental/biological sample. These non-targeted approaches allow for the unbiased investigation of potentially unknown or understudied molecular mediators involved in regulating cell health and disease. These molecular profiles have the potential of being altered in response to toxicant exposures and/or during disease initiation/progression.

To further understand the molecular consequences of -omics-based alterations, molecules can be overlaid onto molecular networks to uncover biological pathways and molecular functions that are perturbed at the systems biology level. An overview of these general methods, starting with high-content technologies and ending of systems biology, is provided in the below figure (created with BioRender.com).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("_book/TAME_Toolkit_files/figure-html/Module2_4_SysBioOverview.png") 
```


A helpful introduction to the field of -omics in relation to environmental health, as well as methods used to relate -omic-level alterations to systems biology, is provided in the following book chapter:

+ Rager JE, Fry RC. Systems Biology and Environmental Exposures. Chpt 4 of 'Network Biology' edited by WenJun Zhang. 2013. ISBN: 978-1-62618-941-3. Nova Science Publishers, Inc. Available at: https://www.novapublishers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/978-1-62618-942-3_ch4.pdf.
  

An additional helpful resource describing computational methods that can be used in systems level analyses is the following book chapter:

+ Meisner M, Reif DM. Computational Methods Used in Systems Biology. Chpt 5 of 'Systems Biology in Toxicology and Environmental Health' edited by Fry RC. 2015: 85-115. ISBN 9780128015643. Academic Press. Available at: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128015643000055.


Parallel to human genomics/epigenomics-based research is the newer "-omics" topic of the **exposome**. The exposome was originally conceptualized as 'all life-course environmental exposures (including lifestyle factors), from the prenatal period onwards ([Wild et al. 2005](https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/14/8/1847.long)). Since then, this concept has received much attention and additional associated definitions. We like to think of the exposome as including anything in ones environment that may impact the overall health of an individual, excluding the individual's genome/epigenome. Common elements evaluated as part of the exposome include environmental exposures, such as chemicals and other substances that may impart toxicity. Additional potential stressors include lifestyle factors, socioeconomic factors, infectious agents, therapeutics, and other stressors that may be altered internally (e.g., microbiome). A helpful review of this research field is provided as the following publication:

+ Wild CP. The exposome: from concept to utility. Int J Epidemiol. 2012 Feb;41(1):24-32. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyr236. Epub 2012 Jan 31. PMID: [22296988](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22296988/).



#### Transcriptomics
One of the most widely evaluated -omics endpoints is messenger RNA (mRNA) expression (also termed gene expression). As a reminder, mRNA molecules are a major type of RNA produced as the "middle step" in the [Central Dogma Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology#:~:text=The%20central%20dogma%20of%20molecular,The%20Central%20Dogma), which describes how genetic DNA is first transcribed into RNA and then translated into protein. Protein molecules are ultimately the major regulators of cellular processes and overall health. Therefore, any perturbations to this process (including changes to mRNA expression levels) can have tremendous consequences on overall cell function and health. A visualization of these steps in the Central Dogma theory are included below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'} 
knitr::include_graphics("_book/TAME_Toolkit_files/figure-html/Module2_4_CentralDogma.png")
```


mRNA expression can be evaluated in a high-throughout/high-content manner, across the genome, and is referred to as the **transcriptome** when doing so. Transcriptomics can be measured using a variety of technologies, including high-density nucleic acid arrays (e.g., DNA microarrays or GeneChip arrays), high-throughput PCR technologies, or RNA sequencing technologies. These methods are used to obtain relative measures of genes that are being expressed or transcribed from DNA by measuring the abundance of mRNA molecules. Results of these methods are often termed as providing gene expression signatures or 'transcriptomes' of a sample under evaluation.


## Introduction to Training Module
This training module incorporates the highly relevant example of RNA sequencing to evaluate the impacts of environmental exposures on cellular responses and general human health. 

**RNA sequencing** is the most common method that is currently implemented to measure the transcriptome. Results from an RNA sequencing platform are often summarized as count data, representing the number of relative times a gene (or other annotated portion of the genome) was 'read' in a given sample. For more details surrounding the methodological underpinnings of RNA sequencing, see the following recent review:

+ Stark R, Grzelak M, Hadfield J. RNA sequencing: the teenage years. Nat Rev Genet. 2019 Nov;20(11):631-656. doi: 10.1038/s41576-019-0150-2. Epub 2019 Jul 24. PMID: [31341269](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31341269/).


In this training module, we guide participants through an example RNA sequencing analysis. Here, we analyze RNA sequencing data collected in a toxicology study evaluating the effects of biomass smoke exposure, representing wildfire-relevant exposure conditions. This study has been previously been described in the following publications:

+ Rager JE, Clark J, Eaves LA, Avula V, Niehoff NM, Kim YH, Jaspers I, Gilmour MI. Mixtures modeling identifies chemical inducers versus repressors of toxicity associated with wildfire smoke. Sci Total Environ. 2021 Jun 25;775:145759. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145759. Epub 2021 Feb 10. PMID: [33611182](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33611182/).

+ Kim YH, Warren SH, Krantz QT, King C, Jaskot R, Preston WT, George BJ, Hays MD, Landis MS, Higuchi M, DeMarini DM, Gilmour MI. Mutagenicity and Lung Toxicity of Smoldering vs. Flaming Emissions from Various Biomass Fuels: Implications for Health Effects from Wildland Fires. Environ Health Perspect. 2018 Jan 24;126(1):017011. doi: 10.1289/EHP2200. PMID: [29373863](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29373863/).

Here, we specifically analyze mRNA sequencing profiles collected in mouse lung tissues. These mice were exposed to two different biomass burn scenarios: smoldering pine needles and flaming pine needles, representing certain wildfire smoke exposure scenarios that can occur. The goal of these analyses is to identify which genes demonstrate altered expression in response to these wildfire-relevant exposures, and identify which biological pathways these genes influence to evaluate findings at the systems biology level.

This training module begins by guiding users through the loading, viewing, and formatting of the example transcriptomics datasets and associated metadata. Methods to carry out quality assurance (QA) / quality control (QC) of the transcriptomics data are then described, which are advantageous to ensure high quality data are included in the final statistical analysis. Because these transcriptomic data were derived from bulk lung tissue samples, consisting of mixed cell populations that could have shifted in response to exposures, data are then adjusted for potential sources of heterogeneity using the R package [RUVseq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RUVSeq.html).

Statistical models are then implemented to identify genes that were significantly differentially expressed between exposed vs unexposed samples. Models are implemented using algorithms within the commonly implemented R package [DESeq2](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8). This package is very convenient, well written, and widely used. The main advantage of this package is that it allows you to perform differential expression analyses and easily obtain various statistics and results with minimal script development on the user-end. 

After obtaining results from differential gene expression analyses, we visualize these results using both MA and volcano plots. Finally, we carry out a systems level analysis through pathway enrichment using the R package [PIANO](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt111) to identify which biological pathways were altered in response to these wildfire-relevant exposure scenarios.



#### Training Module's **Environmental Health Questions**

#### Loading R packages required for this session
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DESeq2)
library(edgeR)
library(RUVSeq)
library(janitor)
library(factoextra)

library(piano)
```



#### Set your working directory
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
setwd("/filepath to where your input files are")
```


#### Loading the Example Transcriptomic Dataset and Metadata

First, let's read in the transcriptional signature data, previously summarized as number of sequence reads per gene (also simply referred to as 'count data') and its associated metadata file:
```{r loaddata, message=F, warning=F, error=F}
# Read in the count data
countdata <- read.csv(file = 'Module2_4/Module2_4_GeneCounts.csv', check.names = FALSE)

# Read in the metadata (describing information on each sample)
sampleinfo <- read.csv(file = "Module2_4/Module2_4_SampleInfo.csv", check.names = FALSE)
```


#### Data Viewing

Let's see how many rows and columns of data are present in the countdata dataframe:
```{r}
dim(countdata)
```

Let's also view the column headers:
```{r}
colnames(countdata)
```

And finally let's view the top few rows of data:
```{r}
head(countdata)
```
Together, this dataframe contains information across 30146 mRNA identifiers, that are labeled according to "Gene name" followed by an underscore and probe number assigned by the platform used in this analysis, BioSpyder TempoSeq Technologies.  

A total of 23 columns are included in this dataframe, the first of which represents the gene identifier, followed by gene count data across 22 samples.


Let's also see what the metadata dataframe looks like:
```{r}
dim(sampleinfo)
```

Let's also view the column headers:
```{r}
colnames(sampleinfo)
```

And finally let's view the top few rows of data:
```{r}
head(sampleinfo)
```
Together, this dataframe contains information across the 22 total samples, that are labeled according to "SampleID_BioSpyderCountFile" header. These identifiers match those used as column headers in the countdata dataframe.

A total of 9 columns are included in this dataframe, including the following:

+ 'SampleID_BioSpyderCountFile': The unique sample identifiers (total n=22)
+ 'PlateBatch': The plate number that was used in the generation of these data.
+ 'MouseID': The unique identifier, that starts with "M" followed by a number, for each mouse used in this study
+ 'NumericID': The unique numeric identifier for each mouse.
+ 'Treatment': The type of exposure condition that each mouse was administered. These include smoldering pine needles, flaming pine needles, vehicle control (saline), and positive inflammation control (LPS, or lipopolysaccharide)
+ 'ID': Another form of identifier that combines the mouse identifier with the exposure condition
+ 'Timepoint': The timepoint at which samples were collected (here, all 4h post-exposure)
+ 'Tissue': The type of tissue that was collected and analyzed (here, all lung tissue)
+ 'Group': The higher level identifier that groups samples together based on exposure condition, timepoint, and tissue


One common QC/preparation step that is helpful when organizing transcriptomics data is to check for potential duplicate mRNA IDs in the countdata. 
```{r}
# Visualize this data quickly by viewing top left corner, 
# to check where ID column is located:
countdata[1:3,1:5]

# Then check for duplicates within column 1 (where the ID column is located):
Dups <- duplicated(countdata[,1])
summary(Dups)
```
  
In this case, because all potential duplicate checks turn up "FALSE", these data do not contain duplicate mRNA identifiers in its current organized format.

#### Formatting Data for Downstream Statistics

Most of the statistical analyses included in this training module will be carried out using the DESeq2 pipeline. This package requires that the count data and sample information data be formatted in a certain manner, which will expedite the downstream coding needed to carry out the statistics. Here, we will walk users through these initial formatting steps.

DESeq2 first requires a 'coldata' dataframe, which includes the sample information (i.e., metadata). Let's create this new dataframe based on the original 'sampleinfo' dataframe:
```{r, message=F, warning=F, error=F}
coldata <- sampleinfo
```


DESeq2 also requires a 'countdata' dataframe, which we've previously created; however, this dataframe requires some minor formatting before it can be used as input for downstream script. 

First, the gene identifiers need to be converted into row names:
```{r, message=F, warning=F, error=F}
countdata <- countdata %>% column_to_rownames("Gene")
```

Then, the column names need to be edited. Let's remind ourselves what the column names are currently:
```{r, message=F, warning=F, error=F}
colnames(countdata)
```

These column identifiers need to be converted into more intuitive sample IDs, that also indicate treatment. This information can be found in the coldata dataframe. Specifically, information in the column labeled 'SampleID_BioSpyderCountFile' will be helpful for these purposes.

To replace these original column identifiers with these more helpful sample identifiers, let's first make sure the order of the countdata columns are in the same order as the coldata column of 'SampleID_BioSpyderCountFile':
```{r, message=F, warning=F, error=F}
countdata <- setcolorder(countdata, as.character(coldata$SampleID_BioSpyderCountFile))
```


Now, we can rename the column names within the countdata dataframe with these more helpful identifiers, since both dataframes are now arranged in the same order:
```{r, message=F, warning=F, error=F}
# Rename the countdata column names with the treatment IDs. 
colnames(countdata) <- coldata$ID 

# Viewing these new column names
colnames(countdata) 
```
These new column identifiers look much better, and can better inform downstream statistical analysis script. Remember that these identifiers indicate that these are mouse samples ("M"), with unique numbers, followed by an underscore and the exposure condition.


When relabeling dataframes, it's always important to triple check any of these major edits. For example, here, let's double check that the same samples appear in the same order between the two working dataframes required for dowstream DESeq2 code:
```{r, message=F, warning=F, error=F}
setequal(as.character(coldata$ID), colnames(countdata))
identical(as.character(coldata$ID), colnames(countdata))
```



## Transcriptomics Data QA/QC
After preparing your transcriptomic data and sample information dataframes for statistical analyses, it is very important to carry out QA/QC on your organized datasets, prior to including all samples and all genes in the actual statistical model. It is critical to only include high quality data that inform underlying biology of exposure responses/disease etiology, rather than data that may contribute noise to the overall data distributions. Some common QA/QC steps and associated data pre-filters carried out in transcriptomics analyses are detailed below.


#### Background Filter
It is very common to perform a background filter step when preparing transcriptomic data for statistical analyses. The goal of this step is to remove genes that are very lowly expressed across the majority of samples, and thus are referred to as universally lowly expressed. Signals from these genes can mute the overall signals that may be identified in -omics analyses. The specific threshold that you may want to apply as the background filter to your dataset will depend on the distribution of your dataset and analysis goal(s).

For this example, we apply a background threshold, to remove genes that are lowly expressed across the majority of samples, specifically defined as genes that have expression levels across at least 20% of the samples that are less than (or equal to) the median expression of all genes across all samples. This will result in including only genes that are expressed above background, that have expression levels in at least 20% of samples that are greater than the overall median expression. Script to apply this filter is detailed below:

```{r backfilt, message=F, warning=F, error=F}
# First count the total number of samples, and save it as a value in the global environment
nsamp <- ncol(countdata)

# Then, calculate the median expression level across all genes and all samples, 
# and save it as a value
total_median <- median(as.matrix(countdata))


# We need to temporarily add back in the Gene column to the countdata 
# so we can filter for genes that pass the background filter
countdata <- countdata %>% rownames_to_column("Gene")

# Then we can apply a set of filters and organization steps (using the tidyverse) 
# to result in a list of genes that have an expression greater than the total median 
# in at least 20% of the samples
genes_above_background <- countdata %>% # Start from the 'countdata' dataframe
  pivot_longer(cols=!Gene, names_to = "sampleID", values_to="expression") %>% # Melt the data so that we have three columns: gene, exposure condition, and expression counts
  mutate(above_median=ifelse(expression>total_median,1,0)) %>% # Add a column that indicates whether the expression of a gene for the corresponding exposure condition is above (1) or not above (0) the median of all count data
  group_by(Gene) %>% # Group the dataframe by the gene
  summarize(total_above_median=sum(above_median)) %>% # For each gene, count the number of exposure conditions where the expression was greater than the median of all count data
  filter(total_above_median>=.2*nsamp) %>% # Filter for genes that have expression above the median in at least 20% of the samples
  select(Gene) # Select just the genes that pass the filter

# Then filter the original 'countdata' dataframe for only the genes above background. 
countdata <- left_join(genes_above_background, countdata, by="Gene")
```

Here, the 'countdata' dataframe went from having 30,146 rows of data (representing genes) to 16,664 rows of data (representing genes with expression levels that passed this background filter)



#### Sample Filtering
Another common QA/QC check is to evaluate whether there are any samples that did not produce adequate RNA material to be measured using the technology employed. Thus, a sample filter can be applied to remove samples that have inadequate data. Here, we demonstrate this filter by checking to see whether there were any samples that resulted in mRNA expression values of zero across all genes. If any sample demonstrates this issue, it should be removed prior to any statistical analysis. Note, there are other filter cut-offs you can use depending on your specific study.

Below is example script that checks for the presence of samples that meet the above criteria:
```{r sampfilt, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# Transpose filtered 'countdata', while keeping data in dataframe format, 
# to allow for script that easily sums the total expression levels per sample
countdata_T <- countdata %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=!Gene, names_to="sampleID",values_to="expression") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=Gene, values_from=expression)

# Then add in a column to the transposed countdata dataframe that sums expression 
# across all genes for each exposure condition
countdata_T$rowsum <- rowSums(countdata_T[2:ncol(countdata_T)])

# Remove samples that have no expression. All samples have some expression 
# in this example, so all samples are retained.
countdata_T <- countdata_T %>% filter(rowsum!=0)

# Take the count data filtered for correct samples, remove the 'rowsums' column
countdata_T <- countdata_T %>% select(!rowsum) 

# Then, transpose it back to the correct format for analysis
countdata <- countdata_T %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=!sampleID, names_to = "Gene",values_to="expression") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sampleID, values_from = "expression")
```


#### Identifying & Removing Sample Outliers
Prior to final statistical analysis, raw transcriptomic data are commonly evaluated for the presence of potential sample outliers. Outliers can result from experimental error, technical error/measurement error, and/or huge sources of variation in biology. For many analyses, it is beneficial to remove such outliers to enhance computational abilities to identify biologically meaningful signals across data. Here, we present two methods to check for the presence of sample outliers:

**1. Principal component analysis (PCA)** can be used to identify potential outliers in a dataset through visualization of summary-level values illustrating reduced representations of the entire dataset. Note that a more detailed description of PCA is provided in **Training Module 2.2**. Here, PCA is run on the raw count data and further analyzed using scree plots, assessing principal components (PCs), and visualized using biplots displaying the first two principal components as a scatter plot. 


**2. Hierarchical clustering** is another approach that can be used to identify potential outliers. Hierarchical clustering aims to cluster data based on a similarity measure, defined by the function and/or specified by the user. There are several R packages and functions that will run hierarchical clustering, but it is often helpful visually to do this in conjuction with a heat map. Here, we use the package pheatmap (introduced in **Training Module 1.4**) with hierarchical clustering across samples to identify potential outliers. 


Let's start by using PCA to identify potential outliers, while providing a visualization of potential sources of variation across the dataset.

First we need to move the Gene column back to the rownames so our dataframe is numeric and we can run the PCA script:
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
countdata <- countdata %>% column_to_rownames("Gene")

# Let's remind ourselves what these data look like
countdata[1:10,1:5] #viewing first 10 rows and 5 columns
```


Then we can calculate principal components using transposed count data:
```{r}
pca <- prcomp(t(countdata))
```


We can visualize the percent variation captured by each principal component (PC) with a scree plot:
```{r, fig.align='center'}
# We can generate a scree plot that shows the eigenvalues of each component, 
# indicating how much of the total variation is captured by each component
fviz_eig(pca)
```
  
This scree plot indicates that nearly all variation is explained in PC1 and PC2, so we are comfortable with viewing these first two PCs when evaluating whether or not potential outliers exist in this dataset.


Further visualization of how these transcriptomic data appear through PCA can be produced through a scatter plot showing the data reduced values per sample:
```{r, fig.align='center'}
# Calculate the percent variation captured by each PC
pca_percent <- round(100*pca$sdev^2/sum(pca$sdev^2),1)

# Make dataframe for PCA plot generation using first two components and the sample name
pca_df <- data.frame(PC1 = pca$x[,1], PC2 = pca$x[,2], Sample=colnames(countdata))

# Organize dataframe so we can color our points by the exposure condition
pca_df <- pca_df %>% separate(Sample, into = c("mouse_num", "expo_cond"), sep="_")

# Plot PC1 and PC2 for each sample and color the point by the exposure condition
ggplot(pca_df, aes(PC1,PC2, color = expo_cond))+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, size=0.3)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, size=0.3)+
  geom_point(size=3) +
  geom_text(aes(label=mouse_num), vjust =-1, size=4)+
  labs(x=paste0("PC1 (",pca_percent[1],"%)"), y=paste0("PC2 (",pca_percent[2],"%)"))+
  ggtitle("PCA for 4h Lung Pine Needles & Control Exposure Conditions")
```
    
With this plot, we can see that samples do not demonstrate obvious groupings, where certain samples group far apart from others. Therefore, our PCA analysis indicates that there are unlikely any sample outliers in this dataset.

#### Hierarchical clustering

<!-- #### Now lets implement hierarchical clustering to identify potential outliers -->

Now lets implement hierarchical clustering to identify potential outliers. First we need to create a dataframe of our transposed 'countdata' such that samples are rows and genes are columns to input into the clustering algorithm.
```{r}
countdata_for_clustering <- t(countdata)

# Viewing what this transposed dataframe looks like
countdata_for_clustering[1:5,1:10] 
```


Next we can run hierarchical clustering in conjunction with the generation of a heat map. Note that we scale these data for improved visualization.
```{r, fig.align='center'}
pheatmap(scale(countdata_for_clustering), main="Hierarchical Clustering",
         cluster_rows=TRUE, cluster_cols = FALSE,
         fontsize_col = 7, treeheight_row = 60, show_colnames = FALSE)
```
    
Like the PCA findings, hierarchical clustering demonstrated an overall lack of potential sample outliers because there were no obvious sample(s) that grouped separately from the rest along the clustering dendrograms.  
Therefore, *neither approach points to outliers that should be removed in this analysis.*

#### Controlling for Sources of Sample Heterogeneity
Because these transcriptomic data were generated from mouse lung tissues, there is potential for these samples to show heterogeneity based on underlying shifts in cell populations (e.g., neutrophil influx) or other aspects of sample heterogeneity (e.g., batch effects from plating, among other sources of heterogeneity that we may want to control for). For these kinds of complex samples, there are data processing methods that can be leveraged to minimize the influence of these sources of heterogeneity. Example methods include Remove Unwanted Variable (RUV), which is discussed here, as well as others (e.g., [Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA)](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/42/21/e161/2903156)).  

Here, we leverage the package called **RUVseq** to employ RUV on this sequencing dataset. Script was developed based off [Bioconductor website](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RUVSeq.html), [vignette](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/RUVSeq/inst/doc/RUVSeq.pdf), and original [publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4404308/).


#### Steps in carrying out RUV using RUVseq on this example dataset:
```{r, message=F, warning=F, error=F}
# First we store the treatment IDs and exposure conditions as a separate vector
ID <- coldata$ID

# And differentiate our treatments and control conditions, first by grabbing 
# the groups associated with each sample
groups <- as.factor(coldata$Group)

# Let's view all the groups
groups

# Then setting a control label
ctrl <- "Saline_4h_Lung"

# And extracting a vector of just our treatment groups
trt_groups <- setdiff(groups,ctrl)

# Let's view this vector
trt_groups
```


RUVseq contains its own set of plotting and normalization functions, though requires input of what's called an object of S4 class SeqExpressionSet. Let's go ahead and make this object, using the RUVseq function 'newSeqExpressionSet':
```{r}
exprSet <- newSeqExpressionSet(as.matrix(countdata),phenoData = 
                                 data.frame(groups,row.names=colnames(countdata)))
```




And then use this object to generate some exploratory plots using built-in tools within RUVseq.
First starting with some boxplots summarizing overall data distributions per sample:
```{r, fig.align='center'}
colors <- brewer.pal(4, "Set2")
plotRLE(exprSet, outline=FALSE, ylim=c(-4, 4), col=colors[groups])
```
  
We can see from this plot that some of the samples show distributions that may vary from the overall - for instance, one of the flaming pine needles-exposed samples (in orange) is far lower than the rest.


Then viewing a PCA plot of these samples:
```{r, fig.align='center'}
colors <- brewer.pal(4, "Set2")
plotPCA(exprSet, col=colors[groups], cex=1.2)
```
  
This PCA plot shows pretty good data distributions, with samples mainly showing groupings based upon exposure condition (e.g., LPS), which is to be expected. With this, we can conclude that there may be some sources of unwanted variation, but not a huge amount. Let's see what the data look like after running RUV.



Now to actually run the RUVseq algorithm, to control for potential sources of sample heterogeneity, we need to first construct a matrix specifying the replicates (samples of the same exposure condition):
```{r}
# Construct a matrix specifying the replicates (samples of the same exposure condition) 
# for running RUV
differences <- makeGroups(groups)

# Viewing this new matrix
head(differences)
```

This matrix groups the samples by exposure condition. Here, each of the four rows represents one of the four exposure conditions, and each of the six columns represents a possible sample. Since the LPS exposure condition only had four samples, instead of six like the rest of the exposure conditions, a value of -1 is automatically used as a place holder to fill out the matrix. The samples in the matrix are identified by the index of the sample in the previously defined 'groups' factor that was used to generate the matrix. For example, the PineNeedlesSmolder_4h_Lung samples are the the first six samples contained in the 'groups' factor, so in the matrix, samples of this exposure condition are identified as '1','2','3','4','5', and '6'. 


Let's now implement the RUVseq algorithm and, for this example, capture one factor (k=1) of unwanted variation. Note that the k parameter can be modified to capture additional factors, if necessary.
```{r}
# Now capture 1 factor (k=1) of unwanted variation
ruv_set <- RUVs(exprSet, rownames(countdata), k=1, differences) 
```


This results in a list of objects within 'ruv_set', which include the following important pieces of information:

(1) Estimated factors of unwanted variation are provided in the phenoData object, as viewed using the following:
```{r}
# viewing the estimated factors of unwanted variation in the column W_1
pData(ruv_set)
```


(2) Normalized counts obtained by regressing the original counts on the unwanted factors (normalizedCounts object within 'ruv_set'). Note that the normalized counts should only used for exploratory purposes and not subsequent differential expression analyses. For additional information on this topic, please refer official RUVSeq documentation. The normalized counts can be viewed using the following:
```{r}
# Viewing the head of the normalized count data, accounting for unwanted variation
head(normCounts(ruv_set))
```


Let's again generate an exploratory plot using this updated dataset, focusing on the bar chart view since that was the most informative pre-RUV. Here are the updated bar charts summarizing overall data distributions per sample:
```{r, fig.align='center'}
colors <- brewer.pal(4, "Set2")
plotRLE(ruv_set, outline=FALSE, ylim=c(-4, 4), col=colors[groups])
```
  
This plot shows overall tighter data that are more similarly distributed across samples. Therefore, it is looking like this RUV addition improved the overall distribution of this dataset. It is important not to over-correct/over-smooth your datasets, so implement these types of pre-processing steps with caution. One strategy that we commonly employ to gauge whether data smoothing is needed/applied correctly is to run the statistical models with and without correction of potential sources of heterogeneity, and critically evaluate similarities vs differences produced in the results.

## Statistical Analysis of Gene Expression

#### Significantly Differentially Expressed Genes
Here, we identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed by environmental exposure conditions (e.g., biomass smoke exposure). At this point, we have completed several data pre-processing, QA/QC, and additional steps to prepare our example transcriptomics data for statistical analysis. Finally, we are ready to run the overall statistical model to identify genes that are altered in expression in association with different biomass burn conditions.  

We will leverage the DESeq2 package to carry out these statistical comparisons. This package is now the most commonly implemented analysis pipeline used for transcriptomic data, including sequencing data as well as transcriptomic data produced via other technologies (e.g., Nanostring, Fluidigm, and other gene expression technologies). This package is extremely well-documented and we encourage trainees to leverage these resources in parallel with the current training module when carrying out their own transcriptomics analyses in R:

+ [Vignette](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html)  
+ [Manual](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/manuals/DESeq2/man/DESeq2.pdf)  
+ Primary citation: Love MI, Huber W, Anders S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2. Genome Biol. 2014;15(12):550. doi: 10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8. PMID: [25516281](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25516281/)  


In brief, the basic calculations employed within the DESeq2 underlying algorithms include the following:
  
**1. Estimate size factors.** 
In the first step, size factors are estimated to help account for potential differences in the sequencing depth across samples. It is similar to a normalization parameter in the model. 

**2. Normalize count data.**
DESeq2 employs different normalization algorithms depending on the parameters selected / stage of analysis. The most commonly employed method is called the **median of ratios**, which takes into account sequencing depth and RNA composition, as described [here](https://hbctraining.github.io/DGE_workshop/lessons/02_DGE_count_normalization.html). Specifically, these normalized values are calculated as counts divided by sample-specific size factors determined by median ratio of gene counts relative to geometric mean per gene. DESeq2 then transforms these data using variance stabilization within the final statistical model. Because of these two steps, we prefer to export both the median of ratios normalized data as well as the variance stabilization transformed data, to save in our records and use when generating plots of expression levels for specific genes we are interested in. These steps are detailed below.

**3. Estimate  dispersion.**
The dispersion estimate takes into account the relationship between the variance of an observed count and its mean value. It is similar to a variance parameter. In DESeq2, dispersion is estimated using a maximum likelihood and empirical bayes approach.

**4. Fit negative binomial generalized linear model (GLM).**
Finally, a negative binomial model is fit for each gene using the design formula that will be described within the proceeding code. The Wald test is performed to test if log fold changes in expression (typically calculated as log(average exposed / average unexposed)) significantly differ from zero. Statistical p-values are reported from this test and also adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure.  
  
Note that these calculations, among others, are embedded within the DESeq2 functions, so we do not need to code for them ourselves. Instead, we just need to make sure that we set-up the DESeq2 functions correctly, such that these calculations are carried out appropriately in our final transcriptomics analyses.


#### Setting up the DESeq2 experiment
Here we provide example script that is used to identify which genes are significantly differentially expressed in association with the example biomass smoke exposures, smoldering pine needles and flaming pine needles, as well as a positive inflammation control, LPS.

First, we need to set-up the DESeq2 experiment:
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# Set up our experiment using our RUV adjusted count and phenotype data.
# Our design indicates that our count data is dependent on the exposure condition 
# (groups variable) and our factor of unwanted variation, and we have specified 
# that there not be an intercept term through the use of '~0'

dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts(ruv_set), # Grabbing count data from the 'ruv_set' object
                                 colData = pData(ruv_set), # Grabbing the phenotype data and corresponding factor of unwanted variation from the 'ruv_set' object
                                 design = ~0+groups+W_1) # Setting up the statistical formula (see below)
```

For the forumula design, we use a '~0' at the front to not include an intercept term, and then also account for the exposure condition (groups) and the previously calculated factors of unwanted variation (W_1) of the samples. Formula design is an important step and should be carefully considered for each individual analysis. Other resources, including official DESeq2 documentation, are avialble for consultation regarding formula design, as the specifics of formula design are beyond the scope of this training module.


#### Estimating size factors
``` {r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# Estimate size factors from the dds object that was just created as the experiment above
dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)
sizeFactors(dds)  # viewing the size factors
```

#### Calculating and exporting normalized counts
``` {r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# Calculating normalized count data
normcounts <- as.data.frame(counts(dds, normalized=TRUE))
write.csv(normcounts, "Module2_4_Output_NormalizedCounts.csv")

# Transforming normalized counts through variance stabilization
vsd <- varianceStabilizingTransformation(dds, blind=FALSE)
vsd_matrix <- as.matrix(assay(vsd))
write.csv(vsd_matrix, "Module2_4_Output_VSDCounts.csv", row.names=TRUE)
```


#### Running the final DESeq2 experiment
Here, we are finally ready to run the actual statistical comparisons (exposed vs control samples) to calculate fold changes and p-values that describe the degree to which each gene may or may not be altered at the expression level in association with treatment.

For this example, we would like to run three different comparisons:  
(1) Smoldering Pine Needles vs. Control  
(2) Flaming Pine Needles vs. Control  
(3) LPS vs. Control  
which we can easily code for using a loop function, as detailed below. 


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# Run experiment
dds_run <- DESeq(dds, betaPrior=FALSE) 

# Loop through and extract and export results for all contrasts (treatments vs. control)
for (trt in trt_groups){ # Iterate for each of the treatments listed in 'trt_groups'
  cat(trt) # Print which treatment group we are on in the loop 
  res <- results(dds_run, pAdjustMethod = "BH", contrast = c("groups",trt,ctrl)) # Extract the results of the DESeq2 analysis specifically for the comparison of the treatment group for the current iteration of the loop with the control group
  summary(res) # Print out a high-level summary of the results
  ordered <- as.data.frame(res[order(res$padj),]) # Make a dataframe of the results and order them by adjusted p-value from lowest to highest
  top10 <- head(ordered, n=10) # Make dataframe of the first ten rows of the ordered results
  cat("\nThe 10 most significantly differentially expressed genes by adjusted p-value:\n\n")
  print(top10) # View the first ten rows of the ordered results
  pfilt.05 <- nrow(ordered %>% filter(padj<0.05)) # Get the number of genes that are significantly differentially expressed where padj < 0.05
  cat("\nThe number of genes showing significant differential expression where padj < 0.05 is ", pfilt.05)
  pfilt.10 <- nrow(ordered %>% filter(padj<0.1)) # Get the number of genes that are significantly differentially expressed where padj < 0.10
  cat("\nThe number of genes showing significant differential expression where padj < 0.10 is ", pfilt.10,"\n\n")
  write.csv(ordered, paste0("Module2_4_Output_StatisticalResults_",trt ,".csv")) # Export the full dataframe of ordered results as a csv
}
```

#### Visualizing Statistical Results 

## MA Plots
[MA plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MA_plot) represent a common method of visualization that illustrates differences between measurements taken in two samples, by transforming the data onto M (log ratio) and A (mean average) scales, then plotting these values.

Here, we leverage MA plots to show how log fold changes relate to expression levels. In these plots, the log fold change is plotted on the y-axis and expression values are plotted along the x-axis, and dots are colored according to statistical significance (using padj<0.05 as the statistical filter). Here we will generate an MA plot for Flaming Pine Needles.


```{r, message=F, warning=F, error=F}

res <- results(dds_run, pAdjustMethod = "BH", contrast = 
                 c("groups","PineNeedlesFlame_4h_Lung",ctrl)) # Re-extract the DESeq2 results for the flamming pine needles 
MA <- data.frame(res) # Make a prelimiary dataframe of the flaming pine needle results
MA_ns <- MA[ which(MA$padj>=0.05),]  # Non-significant genes to plot
MA_up <- MA[ which(MA$padj<0.05 & MA$log2FoldChange > 0),]   # Significant up-regulated genes to plot
MA_down <- MA[ which(MA$padj<0.05 & MA$log2FoldChange < 0),]  #Significant down-regulated genes to plot

ggplot(MA_ns, aes(x = baseMean, y = log2FoldChange)) + # Plot data with counts on x-axis and log2 fold change on y-axis
  geom_point(color="gray75", size = .5) + # Set point size and color
  
  geom_point(data = MA_up, color="firebrick", size=1, show.legend = TRUE) + # Plot the up-regulated significant genes
  geom_point(data = MA_down, color="dodgerblue2", size=1, show.legend = TRUE) + # Plot down-regulated significant genes
  
  theme_bw() + # Change theme of plot from gray to black and white
  
  # We want to log10 transform x-axis for better visualizations
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10", breaks=c(1,10,100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000), 
                     labels=c("1","10","100", "1000", "10000", "100000", "1000000")) + 
  # We will bound y axis as well to better fit data while not leaving out too many points
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(-2, 2)) +
  
  xlab("Expression (Normalized Count)") + ylab("Fold Change (log2)") + # Add labels for axes
  labs(title="MA Plot Flaming Pine Needles 4h Lung") +   # Add title
  geom_hline(yintercept=0) # Add horizontal line at 0
```



## Volcano Plots

Similar to MA plots, volcano plots provide visualizations of fold changes in expression from transcriptomic data. However, instead of plotting these values against expression, log fold change is plotted against (adjusted) p-values in volcano plots. Here, we use functions within the [EnhancedVolcano package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/EnhancedVolcano/versions/1.11.3/topics/EnhancedVolcano) to generate a volcano plot for Flaming Pine Needles. 

Running the 'EnhancedVolcano' function to generate an example volcano plot:
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
Vol <- data.frame(res) # Dataset to use for plotting
EnhancedVolcano(Vol, 
                lab = rownames(res), # Label information from dataset (can be a column name)
                x = 'log2FoldChange', # Column name in dataset with l2fc information
                y = 'padj', # Column name in dataset with adjusted p-value information
                ylab = "-Log(FDR-adjusted p)", # Y-axis label
                pCutoff= 0.05, # Set p-value cutoff
                ylim=c(0,5), # Limit y-axis for better plot visuals
                xlim=c(-2,2), # Limit x-axis (similar to in MA plot y-axis)
                title="Volcano Plot", # Set title
                subtitle = "Flaming Pine Needles 4h Lung", # Set subtitle
                legendPosition = 'bottom') # Put legend on bottom
```



## Pathway Enrichment Analysis
#### Interpretting Findings using Pathway Enrichment Analysis

Pathway enrichment analysis is a very helpful tool that can be applied to interpret transcriptomic changes of interest in terms of systems biology. In these types of analyses, gene lists of interest are used to identify biological pathways that include genes present in your dataset more often than expected by chance alone.  There are many tools that can be used to carry out pathway enrichment analyses. Here, we are using the R package, PIANO, to carry out the statistical enrichment analysis based on the lists of genes we previously identified with differential expression associated with flaming pine needles exposure. 

To detail, the following input data are required to run PIANO: 

1. Your background gene sets, which represent all genes queried from your experiment (aka your 'gene universe') 
2. The list of genes you are interested in evaluating pathway enrichment of; here, this represents the genes identified with significant differential expression associated with flaming pine needles  
3. A underlying pathway dataset; here, we're using the KEGG PATHWAY Database ([KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html)), summarized through the Molecular Signature Database ([MSigDB](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/)) into pre-formatted input files (.gmt) ready for PIANO.

*Let's organize these three required data inputs.*


1. Background gene set:
```{r}
# First grab the rownames of the 'res' object, which was redefined as the DESeq2 
# results for flaming pine needles prior to MA plot generation, and remove the 
# BioSpyder numeric identifier using a sub function, while maintaining the gene 
# symbol and place these IDs into a new list within the 'res' object (saved as 'id')
res$id <- gsub("_.*", "", rownames(res));

# Because these IDs now contain duplicate gene symbols, we need to remove duplicates
# One way to do this is to preferentially retain rows of data with the largest 
# fold change (it doesn't really matter here, because we're just identifying 
# unique genes within the background set)
res.ordered <- res[order(res$id, -abs(res$log2FoldChange) ), ] # sort by id and reverse of abs(log2foldchange)
res.ordered <- res.ordered[ !duplicated(res.ordered$id), ]     # removing gene duplicates

# Setting this as the background list
Background <- toupper(as.character(res.ordered$id))
Background[1:200] # viewing the first 200 genes in this background list
```

2. The list of genes identified with significant differential expression associated with flaming pine needles:
```{r}
# Similar to the above script, but starting with the res$id object
# and filtering for genes with padj < 0.05

# Ordering by negative absolute value of log2FoldChange
res.ordered <- res[order(res$id, -abs(res$log2FoldChange) ), ] 

# Pulling the genes with padj < 0.05
SigGenes <- toupper(as.character(res.ordered[which(res.ordered$padj<.05),"id"])) 

# Removing gene duplicates
SigGenes <- SigGenes[ !duplicated(SigGenes)] 

# Viewing the length of this significant gene list
length(SigGenes) 
```

Therefore, this gene set includes 488 *unique* genes significantly associated with the Flaming Pine Needles condition, based on padj<0.05.


3. The underlying KEGG pathway dataset.

Note that this file was simply downloaded from [MSigDB](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/), ready for upload as a .gmt file. Here, we use the 'loadGSC' function enabled through the PIANO package to upload and organize these pathways.
```{r}
KEGG_Pathways <- loadGSC(file="Module2_4/Module2_4_kegg_v7_symbols.gmt", type="gmt")

# Viewing the number of biological pathways contained in the database
length(KEGG_Pathways$gsc) 
```
This KEGG pathway database therefore includes 186 biological pathways available to query.


With these data inputs ready, we can now run the pathway enrichment analysis. The enrichment statistic that is commonly employed through the PIANO package is based of a hypergeometric test, run through the 'runGSAhyper' function. This returns a p-value for each gene set from which you can determine enrichment status.
```{r, message=F, warning=F, error=F}
# Running the piano function based on the hypergeometric statistic
Results_GSA <- piano::runGSAhyper(genes=SigGenes, universe=Background,
                                  gsc=KEGG_Pathways, gsSizeLim=c(1,Inf), adjMethod = "fdr")

# Pulling the pathway enrichment results into a separate dataframe
PathwayResults <- as.data.frame(Results_GSA$resTab)

# Viewing the top of these pathway enrichment results (which are not ordered at the moment)
head(PathwayResults)

```
This dataframe therefore summarizes the enrichment p-value for each pathway, FDR adjusted p-value, number of significant genes in the gene set that intersect with genes in the pathway, etc.


With these results, let's identify which pathways meet a statistical enrichment p-value filter of 0.05:
```{r}
SigPathways <- PathwayResults[which(PathwayResults$`p-value` < 0.05),]
rownames(SigPathways)
```

#### Introduction to Toxicokinetic Modeling

To understand what toxicokinetic modeling is, consider the following scenario:
```{r, echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics("Module2_5/Module2_5_TK_Intro_Image.png")
```

Simply put, toxicokinetics answers these questions by describing "what the body does to the chemical" after an exposure scenario.

More technically, **toxicokinetic modeling** refers to the evaluation of the uptake and disposition of a chemical in the body.

#### Notes on terminology
Pharmacokinetics (PK) is a synonym for toxicokinetics (TK). They are often used interchangeably. PK connotes pharmaceuticals; TK connotes environmental chemicals – but those connotations are weak.

A common abbreviation that you will also see in this research field is **ADME**, which stands for:  

+ **Absorption:** How does the chemical get absorbed into the body tissues?  
+ **Distribution:** Where does the chemical go inside the body?  
+ **Metabolism:** How do enzymes in the body break apart the chemical molecules?  
+ **Excretion:** How does the chemical leave the body?  

To place this term into the context of TK, TK models describe ADME mathematically by representing the body as compartments and flows.


#### Types of TK models
TK models describe the body mathematically as one or more "compartments" connected by "flows." The compartments represent organs or tissues. Using mass balance equations, the amount or concentration of chemical in each compartment is described as a function of time.

Types of models discussed throughout this training module are described here.

#### 1 Compartment Model
The simplest TK model is a 1-compartment model, where the body is assumed to be one big well-mixed compartment.

#### 3 Compartment Model
A 3-compartment model mathematically incorporates three distinct body compartments, that can exhibit different parameters contributing to their individual mass balance. Commonly used compartments in 3-compartment modeling can include tissues like blood plasma, liver, gut, kidney, and/or 'rest of body' terms; though the specific compartments included depend on the chemical under evaluation, exposure scenario, and modeling assumptions.

#### PBTK Model 
A physiologically-based TK (PBTK) model incorporates compartments and flows that represent real physiological quantities (as opposed to the aforementioned empirical 1- and 3-compartment models). PBTK models have more parameters overall, including parameters representing physiological quantities that are known *a priori* based on studies of anatomy. The only PBTK model parameters that need to be estimated for each new chemical are parameters representing chemical-body interactions, which can include the following:  

- Rate of hepatic metabolism of chemical: How fast does liver break down chemical?
- Plasma protein binding: How tightly does the chemical bind to proteins in blood plasma? Liver may not be able to break down chemical that is bound to plasma protein.
- Blood:tissue partition coefficients: Assuming chemical diffuses between blood and other tissues very fast compared to the rate of blood flow, the ratio of concentration in blood to concentration in each tissue is approximately constant = partition coefficient.
- Rate of active transport into/out of a tissue: If chemical moves between blood and tissues not just by passive diffusion, but by cells actively transporting it in or out of the tissue
- Binding to other tissues: Some chemical may be bound inside a tissue and not available for diffusion or transport in/out


Types of TK modeling can also fall into the following major categories:  

1. **Forward TK Modeling:** Where external exposure doses are converted into internal doses (or concentrations of chemicals/drugs in one or more body tissues of interest).
2. **Reverse TK Modeling:** The reverse of the above, where internal doses are converted into external exposure doses.



#### Other TK modeling resources

For further information on TK modeling background, math, and example models, there are additional resources online including a helpful course website on [Basic Pharmacokinetics](https://www.boomer.org/c/p4/) by Dr. Bourne.


## Introduction to Training Module
This module serves as an example to guide trainees through the basics of toxicokinetic (TK) modeling and how this type of modeling can be used in the high-throughput setting for environmental health research applications. 

In this activity, the capabilities of a high-throughput toxicokinetic modeling package titled 'httk' are demonstrated on a suite of environmentally relevant chemicals. The httk R package implements high-throughput toxicokinetic modeling (hence, 'httk'), including a generic physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model as well as tables of chemical-specific parameters needed to solve the model for hundreds of chemicals. In this activity, the capabilities of 'httk' are demonstrated and explored. Example modeling estimates are produced for the high interest environmental chemical, bisphenol-A. Then, an example script is provided to derive the plasma concentration at steady state for an example environmental chemical, bisphenol-A.

The concept of reverse toxicokinetics is explained and demonstrated, again using bisphenol-A as an example chemical.

This module then demonstrates the derivation of the bioactivity-exposure ratio (BER) across many chemicals leveraging the capabilities of httk, while incorporating exposure measures. BERs are particularly useful in the evaluation of chemical risk, as they take into account both toxicity (i.e., *in vitro* potency) and exposure rates, the two essential components used in risk calculations for chemical safety and prioritization evaluations. Therefore, the estimates of both potency and exposure and needed to calculate BERs, which are described in this training module.

For potency estimates, the ToxCast high-throughput screening library is introduced as an example high-throughput dataset to carry out in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) modeling through httk. ToxCast activity concentrations that elicit 50% maximal bioactivity (AC50) are uploaded and organized as inputs, and then the tenth percentile ToxCast AC50 is calculated for each chemical (in other words, across all ToxCast screening assays, the tenth percentile of AC50 values were carried forward). These concentration estimates then serve as concentration estimates for potency. For exposure estimates, previously generated exposure estimates that have been inferred from CDC NHANES urinary biomonitoring data are used. 

The bioactivity-exposure ratio (BER) is then calculated across chemicals with both potency and exposure estimate information. This ratio is simply calculated as the ratio of the lower-end equivalent dose (for the most-sensitive 5\% of the population) divided by the upper-end estimated exposure (here, the upper bound on the inferred population median exposure). Chemicals are then ranked based on resulting BERs and visualized through plots. The importance of these chemical prioritization are then discussed in relation to environmental health research and corresponding regulatory decisions.


#### Training Module's **Environmental Health Questions**
This training module was specifically developed to answer the following environmental health questions:

(1) After solving the TK model that evaluates bisphenol-A, what is the maximum concentration of bisphenol-A estimated to occur in human plasma, after 1 exposure dose of 1 mg/kg/day?
(2) After solving the TK model that evaluates bisphenol-A, what is the steady-state concentration of bisphenol-A estimated to occur in human plasma, for a long-term oral infusion dose of 1 mg/kg/day?
(3) What is the predicted range of bisphenol-A concentrations in plasma that can occur in a human population, assuming a long-term exposure rate of 1 mg/kg/day and steady-state conditions? Provide estimates at the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile?
(4) Considering the chemicals evaluated in the above TK modeling example, do the $C_{ss}$-dose slope distributions become wider as the median $C_{ss}$-dose slope increases?
(5) How many chemicals have available AC50 values to evaluate in the current ToxCast/Tox21 high-throughput screening database?
(6) What are the chemicals with the ten lowest predicted equivalent doses (for tenth-percentile ToxCast AC50s), for the most-sensitive 5\% of the population?
(7) Based on httk modeling estimates, are chemicals with higher bioactivity-exposure ratios always less potent than chemicals with lower bioactivity-exposure ratios?
(8) Based on httk modeling estimates, do chemicals with higher bioactivity-exposure ratios always have lower estimated exposures than chemicals with lower bioactivity-exposure ratios?
(9) How are chemical prioritization results different when using only hazard information vs. only exposure information vs. bioactivity-exposure ratios?

## Data and Models used in Toxicokinetic Modeling (TK)

#### Common Models used in TK Modeling
<!-- , that are Provided as Built-in Models in 'httk' -->

There are five TK models currently built into `httk`. They are:

+ `pbtk`: A physiologically-based TK model with oral absorption. Contains the following compartments: gutlumen, gut, liver, kidneys, veins, arteries, lungs, and the rest of the body. Chemical is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys via glomerular filtration.
+ `gas_pbtk`: A PBTK model with absorption via inhalation. Contains the same compartments as `pbtk`.
+ `1compartment`: A simple one-compartment TK model with oral absorption.
+ `3compartment`:  A three-compartment TK model with oral absorption. Compartments are gut, liver, and rest of body.
+ `3compartmentss`: The steady-state solution to the 3-compartment model under an assumption of constant infusion dosing, without considering tissue partitioning. This was the first `httk` model (see Wambaugh et al. 2015, Wetmore et al. 2012, Rotroff et al. 2010).

#### Chemical-Specific TK Data Built Into 'httk'

Each of these TK models has chemical-specific parameters. The chemical-specific TK information needed to parameterize these models is built into `httk`, in the form of a built-in lookup table in a data.frame called `chem.physical_and_invitro.data`. This lookup table means that in order to run a TK model for a particular chemical, you only need to specify the chemical. 

Look at the first few rows of this data.frame to see everything that's in there (it is a lot of information).

```{r}
head(chem.physical_and_invitro.data)
```

The table contains chemical identifiers: name, CASRN (Chemical Abstract Service Registry Number), and DTXSID (DSSTox ID, a chemical identifier from the EPA Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity Database, DSSTox for short -- more information can be found at https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/distributed-structure-searchable-toxicity-dsstox-database). The table also contains physical-chemical properties for each chemical. These are used in predicting tissue partitioning. 

The table contains *in vitro* measured chemical-specific TK parameters, if available. These chemical-specific parameters include intrinsic hepatic clearance (`Clint`) and fraction unbound to plasma protein (`Funbound.plasma`) for each chemical. It also contains measured values for oral absorption fraction `Fgutabs`, and for the partition coefficient between blood and plasma `Rblood2plasma`, if these values have been measured for a given chemical. If available, there may be chemical-specific TK values for multiple species. 

#### Listing chemicals for which a TK model can be parameterized

You can easily get a list of all the chemicals for which a specific TK model can be parameterized (for a given species, if needed) using the function `get_cheminfo()`. 

For example, here is how you get a list of all the chemicals for which the PBTK model can be parameterized for humans.

```{r}
chems_pbtk <- get_cheminfo(info = c("Compound", "CAS", "DTXSID"),
                           model = "pbtk",
                           species = "Human")

head(chems_pbtk) # First few rows
```

How many such chemicals have parameter data to run a PBTK model in this package?

```{r}
nrow(chems_pbtk)
```

Here is how you get all the chemicals for which the 3-compartment steady-state model can be parameterized for humans.

```{r}
chems_3compss <- get_cheminfo(info = c("Compound", "CAS", "DTXSID"),
                           model = "3compartmentss",
                           species = "Human")
```

How many such chemicals have parameter data to run a 3-compartment steady-state model in this package?

```{r}
nrow(chems_3compss)
```

The 3-compartment steady-state model can be parameterized for a few more chemicals than the PBTK model, because it is a simpler model and requires less data to parameterize. Specifically, the 3-compartment steady-state model does not require estimating tissue partition coefficients, unlike the PBTK model.

#### Solving Toxicokinetic Models to Obtain Internal Chemical Concentration vs. Time Predictions

You can solve any of the models for a specified chemical and specified dosing protocol, and get concentration vs. time predictions, using the function `solve_model()`. For example:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
sol_pbtk <- solve_model(chem.name = "Bisphenol-A", # Chemical to simulate
            model = "pbtk", # TK model to use
            dosing = list(initial.dose = NULL, # For repeated dosing, if first dose is different from the rest, specify first dose here
                          doses.per.day = 1, # Number of doses per day
                          daily.dose = 1, # Total daily dose in mg/kg units
                          dosing.matrix = NULL), # Used to specify more complicated dosing protocols
            days = 1) # Number of days to simulate
```

There are some cryptic-sounding warnings that can safely be ignored. (They are providing information about certain assumptions that were made while solving the model). Then there is a final message providing the units of the output.

The output, assigned to `sol_pbtk`, is a matrix with concentration vs. time data for each of the compartments in the `pbtk` model. Time is in units of days. Additionally, the output traces the amount excreted via passive renal filtration (`Atubules`), the amount metabolized in the liver (`Ametabolized`), and the cumulative area under the curve for plasma concentration vs. time (`AUC`). AUC is the area under the curve of the plasma concentration. Here are the first few rows of `sol_pbtk` so you can see the format.

```{r}
head(sol_pbtk)
```

You can plot the results, for example plasma concentration vs. time.

```{r}
sol_pbtk <- as.data.frame(sol_pbtk) # Because ggplot2 requires data.frame input, not matrix

ggplot(sol_pbtk) +
  geom_line(aes(x = time,
                y = Cplasma)) +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Time, days") +
  ylab("Cplasma, uM") +
  ggtitle("Plasma concentration vs. time for single dose 1 mg/kg Bisphenol-A")
```

#### Calculating summary metrics of internal dose produced from TK models

We can calculate summary metrics of internal dose -- peak concentration, average concentration, and AUC -- using the function `calc_tkstats()`. We have to specify the dosing protocol and length of simulation. Here, we use the same dosing protocol and simulation length as in the plot above.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
tkstats <- calc_tkstats(chem.name = "Bisphenol-A", # Chemical to simulate
             stats = c("AUC", "peak", "mean"), # Which metrics to return (these are the only three choices)
             model = "pbtk", # Model to use

## Calculating steady-state concentration

Another summary metric is the steady-state concentration: If the same dose is given repeatedly over many days, the body concentration will (usually) reach a steady state after some time. The value of this steady-state concentration, and the time needed to achieve steady state, are different for different chemicals. Steady-state concentrations are useful when considering long-term, low=level exposures, which is frequently the situation in environmental health.

For example, here is a plot of plasma concentration vs. time for 1 mg/kg/day Bisphenol-A, administered for 12 days. You can see how the average plasma concentration reaches a steady state around 1.5 uM. Each peak represents one day's dose.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
plasma_conc_plot <- as.data.frame(solve_pbtk(
                    chem.name='Bisphenol-A',
                    daily.dose=1,
                    days=12,
                    doses.per.day=1,
                    tsteps=2))

ggplot(plasma_conc_plot) +
  geom_line(aes(x = time,
                y= Cplasma)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,12)) +
  xlab("Time, days") +
  ylab("Cplasma, uM")
```


`httk` includes a function `calc_analytic_css()` to calculate the steady-state plasma concentration ($C_{ss}$ for short) analytically for each model, for a specified chemical and daily oral dose. This function assumes that the daily oral dose is administered as an oral infusion, rather than a single oral bolus dose -- in effect, that the daily dose is divided into many small doses over the day. Therefore, the result of `calc_analytic_css()` may be slightly different than our previous estimate based on the concentration vs. time plot from a single oral bolus dose every day.

Here is the result of `calc_analytic_css()` for a 1 mg/kg/day dose of bisphenol-A.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
calc_analytic_css(chem.name = "Bisphenol-A",
                  daily.dose = 1,
                  output.units = "uM",
                  model = "pbtk",
                  concentration = "plasma")
```

#### Steady-state concentration is linear with dose for `httk` models

For the TK models included in the `httk` package, steady-state concentration is linear with dose for a given chemical. The slope of the line is simply the steady-state concentration for a dose of 1 mg/kg/day. This can be shown by solving `calc_analytic_css()` for several doses, and plotting the dose-$C_{ss}$ points along a line whose slope is equal to $C_{ss}$ for 1 mg/kg/day.

```{r}
# Choose five doses at which to find the Css
doses <- c(0.1, # Qll mg/kg/day
           0.5,
           1.0,
           1.5,
           2.0)
suppressWarnings(bpa_css <- sapply(doses,
                  function(dose) calc_analytic_css(chem.name = "Bisphenol-A",
                  daily.dose = dose,
                  output.units = "uM",
                  model = "pbtk",
                  concentration = "plasma",
                  suppress.messages = TRUE)))

DF <- data.frame(dose = doses,
                 Css = bpa_css)

#Plot the results
Cssdosefig  <- ggplot(DF) +

                 y = Css),

    intercept = 0, #intercept 0
              slope = DF[DF$dose==1, # Slope = Css for 1 mg/kg/day

## Reverse Toxicokinetics

In the previous TK examples, we started with a specified dosing protocol, then solved the TK models to find the resulting concentration in the body (e.g., in plasma). This allows us to convert from external exposure metrics to internal exposure metrics. However, many environmental health questions require the reverse: converting from internal exposure metrics to external exposure metrics. 

For example, when health effects of environmental chemicals are studied in epidemiological cohorts, adverse health effects are often related to *internal* exposure metrics, such as blood or plasma concentration of a chemical. Similarly, *in vitro* studies of chemical bioactivity (for example, the ToxCast program) relate bioactivity to *in vitro* concentration, which can be consdered analogous to internal exposure or body concentration. So we may know the *internal* exposure level associated with some adverse health effect of a chemical.

However, risk assessors and risk managers typically control *external* exposure to reduce the risk of adverse health effects. They need some way to start from an internal exposure associated with adverse health effects, and convert to the corresponding external exposure. 

The solution is *reverse toxicokinetics* (reverse TK). Starting with a specified internal exposure metric (body concentration), solve the TK model *in reverse* to find the corresponding external exposure that produced that concentration.

When exposures are long-term and low-level (as environmental exposures often are), then the relevant internal exposure metric is the steady-state concentration. In this case, it is useful to remember the linear relationship between $C_{ss}$ and dose for the `httk` TK models. It gives you a quick and easy way to perform reverse TK for the steady-state case.

The procedure is illustrated graphically below. 

1. Begin with a "target" concentration on the y-axis (labeled $C_{\textrm{target}}$). For example, $C_{\textrm{target}}$ may be the *in vitro* concentration associated with bioactivity in a ToxCast assay, or the plasma concentration associated with an adverse health effect in an epidemiological study.
2. Draw a horizontal line over to the $C_{ss}$-dose line.
3. Drop down vertically to the x-axis and read off the corresponding dose. This is the *administered equivalent dose* (AED): the the external dose or exposure rate, in mg/kg/day, that would produce an internal steady-state plasma concentration equal to the target concentration.

print(reverseTKfig)
  
```

Mathematically, the relation is very simple:

$$ AED = \frac{C_{\textrm{target}}}{C_{ss}\textrm{-dose slope}} $$

Since the $C_{ss}$-dose slope is simply $C_{ss}$ for a daily dose of 1 mg/kg/day, this equation can be rewritten as

$$ AED = \frac{C_{\textrm{target}}}{C_{ss}\textrm{ for 1 mg/kg/day}} $$

#### Capturing Population Variability and Uncertainty 

For a given dose, $C_{ss}$ is determined by the values of the parameters of the TK model. These parameters describe absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of each chemical. They include both chemical-specific parameters, describing hepatic clearance and protein binding, and chemical-independent parameters, describing physiology. A table of these parameters is presented below.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = TRUE}
paramtable <- data.frame("Parameter" = c("Intrinsic hepatic clearance rate",
                                         "Fraction unbound to plasma protein",

                                    rep("Chemical-independent", 4))
)

Because these parameters represent physiology and chemical-body interactions, their exact values will vary across individuals in a population, reflecting population physiological variability. Additionally, parameters are subject to measurement uncertainty. 

Since the $C_{ss}$-dose relation is determined by these parameters, variability and uncertainty in the TK parameters translates directly into variability and uncertainty in $C_{ss}$ for a given dose. In other words, there is a distribution of $C_{ss}$ values for each daily dose level of a chemical.

The $C_{ss}$-dose relationship is still linear when variability and uncertainty are taken into account. However, rather than a single $C_{ss}$-dose slope, there is a distribution of $C_{ss}$-dose slopes. Because the $C_{ss}$-dose slope is simply the $C_{ss}$ value for an exposure rate of 1 mg/kg/day, the distribution of the $C_{ss}$-dose slope is the same as the $C_{ss}$ distribution for an exposure rate of 1 mg/kg/day. 

A distribution of $C_{ss}$-dose slopes is illustrated in the figure below, along with boxplots illustrating the distributions for $C_{ss}$ itself at five different dose levels: 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 0.95 mg/kg/day.

#### Variability and Uncertainty in Reverse Toxicokinetics

Earlier, we found that with a linear $C_{ss}$-dose relation, reverse toxicokinetics became a matter of a simple linear equation. For a given target concentration -- for example, a plasma concentration associated with adverse health effects *in vivo*, or a concentration associated with bioactivity *in vitro* -- we could predict an AED (administered equivalent dose), the external exposure rate in mg/kg/day that would produce the target concentration at steady state.

$$ AED = \frac{C_{\textrm{target}}}{C_{ss}\textrm{-dose slope}} $$

Since AED depends on the $C_{ss}$-dose slope, variability and uncertainty in that slope will induce variability and uncertainty in the AED. A distribution of slopes will lead to a distribution of AEDs for the same target concentration.

For example, a graphical representation of finding the AED distribution for a target concentration of 1 uM looks like this, for the same arbitrary example chemical used to illustrate the distribution of $C_{ss}$-dose slopes above. (The lines shown in this plot are the same as the previous plot, but the plot has been "zoomed in" on the y-axis.) 

The steps are the same as before:

1. Begin with a "target" concentration on the y-axis, here 1 uM.
2. Draw a horizontal line over to intersect each $C_{ss}$-dose line.
3. Where the horizontal line intersects each $C_{ss}$-dose line, drop down vertically to the x-axis and read off each corresponding AED (marked with colored circles matching the color of each $C_{ss}$-dose line).

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

ggplot(css_dist_wide,
       aes(x=dose, y = `95%`)) +
  geom_blank() +
  geom_abline(data = slope_dist,
              aes(intercept  =0,
                  slope = slope,
                  color = quantile),
              size = 1) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 1)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 1/css_examp,
                   xend = 1/css_examp,
                   y = 1,
                   yend = -Inf)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = 1/css_examp,
                 y = -Inf,
                 color = factor(c("5%", "25%", "50%", "75%", "95%"),
                                levels = levels(slope_dist$quantile))
                 ),
                 size = 5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = plotcols,
                     limits = levels(slope_dist$quantile),
                     name = "Percentile") +
  xlab("Daily dose, mg/kg/day") +
  ylab("Css, uM") +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,5),
                  clip = "off")
```

Notice that the line with the steepest, 95th-percentile slope (the purple line) yields the lowest AED (the purple dot, approximately 0.07 mg/kg/day for this example chemical), and the line with the shallowest, 5th-percentile slope (the turquoise blue line) yields the highest AED (the turquoise dot, approximately 2 mg/kg/day for this example chemical).

In general, the 95th-percentile $C_{ss}$-dose slope represents the most-sensitive 5\% of the population -- individuals who will reach the target concentration in their body with the smallest daily doses. Therefore, using the AED for the 95th-percentile $C_{ss}$-dose slope is a conservative choice, health-protective for 95\% of the estimated population.


## Monte Carlo Approach 
The `httk` package implements a Monte Carlo approach for simulating variability and uncertainty in TK.  

`httk` first defines distributions for the TK model parameters, representing population variabilty. These distributions are defined based on real data about U.S. population demographics and physiology collected as part of the Centers for Disease Control's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [(Ring et al., 2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28628784/). TK parameters with known measurement uncertainty (intrinsic hepatic clearance rate and fraction of chemical unbound in plasma) additionally have distributions defined to represent their uncertainty [(Wambaugh et al., 2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31532498/).

Then, `httk` samples sets of TK parameter values from these distributions (including appropriate correlations: for example, liver mass is correlated with body weight). Each sampled set of TK parameter values represents one "simulated individual." 

Next, `httk` calculates the $C_{ss}$-dose slope for each "simulated individual." The resulting sample of $C_{ss}$-dose slopes can be used to characterize the distribution of $C_{ss}$-dose slopes -- for example, by calculating percentiles.

`httk` makes this whole Monte Carlo process simple and transparent for the user, You just need to call one function, `calc_mc_css()`, specifying the chemical whose $C_{ss}$-dose slope distribution you want to calculate. Behind the scenes, `httk` will perform all the Monte Carlo calculations. It will return percentiles of the $C_{ss}$-dose slope (by default), or it can return all individual samples of $C_{ss}$-dose slope (if you want to do some calculations of your own).

## Chemical-Specific Example

Here is an example of capturing population variability for bisphenol-A plasma concentration estimates. The following code estimates the 5th percentile, 50th percentile, and 95th percentile of the $C_{ss}$-dose slope for the chemical bisphenol-A. For the sake of simplicity, we will use the 3-compartment steady-state model (rather than the PBTK model used in the previous examples). 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
css_examp <- calc_mc_css(chem.name = "Bisphenol-A",
            which.quantile = c(0.05, # Specify which quantiles to return
                               0.5,
                               0.95),
            model = "3compartmentss", # Which model to use to calculate Css
            output.units = "uM") # Could also choose mg/Lo

print(css_examp)
```

Recall that the $C_{ss}$-dose slope is the same as $C_{ss}$ for a daily dose of 1 mg/kg/day. The function `calc_mc_css()` therefore assumes a dose of 1 mg/kg/day and calculates the resulting $C_{ss}$ distribution. If you need to calculate the $C_{ss}$ distribution for a different dose, e.g. 2 mg/kg/day, you can simply multiply the $C_{ss}$ percentiles from `calc_mc_css()` by your desired dose.

The steady-state plasma concentration for 1 mg/kg/day dose is returned in units of uM. The three requested quantiles are returned as a named numeric vector (whose names in this case are `5%`, `50%`, and `95%`).

#### High-Throughput Example Capturing Population Variability for ~1000 Chemicals

We can easily and (fairly) quickly do this for all 998 chemicals for which the 3-compartment steady-state model can be parameterized, using `sapply()` to loop over the chemicals. This will take a few minutes to run (for example, it takes about 10-15 minutes on a Dell Latitude with an Intel i7 processor).

In order to make the Monte Carlo sampling reproducible, set a seed for the random number generator. It doesn't matter what seed you choose -- it can be any integer. Here, the seed is set to 42, because it's the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything [(Adams, 1979)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(novel)).

```{r}
set.seed(42)

system.time(
  suppressWarnings(
    css_3compss <- sapply(chems_3compss$CAS,
              calc_mc_css,
              # Additional arguments to calc_mc_css()
              model = "3compartmentss",
              which.quantile = c(0.05, 0.5, 0.95),
              output.units = "uM",
              suppress.messages = TRUE)
              )
)
```

Organizing the results:
```{r}
# Css_3compss comes out as a 3 x 998 array,
# Where rows are quantiles and columns are chemicals
# Transpose it so that rows are chemicals and columns are quantiles
css_3compss <- t(css_3compss)
# Convert to data.frame
css_3compss <- as.data.frame(css_3compss)
# Make a column for CAS, rather than just leaving it as the row names
css_3compss$CAS <- row.names(css_3compss)

head(css_3compss) #View first few rows
```


#### Plotting the $C_{ss}$-dose slope distribution quantiles 

Here, we will plot the resulting concentration distribution quantiles for each chemical, while sorting the chemicals from lowest to highest median value.

By default, `ggplot2` will plot the chemical CASRNs in alphabetically-sorted order. To force it to plot them in another order, we have to explicitly specify the desired order. The easiest way to do this is to add a column in the data.frame that contains the chemical names as a factor (categorical) variable, whose levels (categories) are explicitly set to be the CASRNs in our desired plotting order. Then we can tell `ggplot2` to plot that factor variable on the x-axis, rather than the original CASRN variable.

Set the ordering of the chemical CASRNs from lowest to highest median value:
```{r}
chemical_order <- order(css_3compss$`50%`)
```

Create a factor (categorical) CAS column where the factor levels are given by the CASRNs with this ordering.

```{r}
css_3compss$CAS_factor <- factor(css_3compss$CAS, levels = css_3compss$CAS[chemical_order])
```

For plotting ease, reshape the data.frame into "long" format -- rather than having one column for each quantile of the $C_{ss}$ distribution, have a row for each chemical/quantile combination. We use the `melt` function from the `reshape2` package.

```{r}
css_3compss_melt <- melt(css_3compss,
                                   id.vars = "CAS_factor",
                                   measure.vars = c("5%", "50%", "95%"),
                                   variable.name = "Percentile",
                                   value.name = "Css_slope")
head(css_3compss_melt)
```

Plot the slope percentiles. Use a log scale for the y-axis because the slopes span orders of magnitude. Suppress the x-axis labels (the CASRNs) because they are not readable anyway.

```{r}
ggplot(css_3compss_melt) +
  geom_point(aes(x=CAS_factor,
                 y = Css_slope,
                 color = Percentile)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") + # Use better color scheme than default
  scale_y_log10() + # Use log scale for y axis
  xlab("Chemical") +
  ylab("Css-dose slope (uM per mg/kg/day)") +
  annotation_logticks(sides = "l") + # Add log ticks to y axis
  theme_bw() + # Plot with white plot background instead of gray
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), # Suppress x-axis labels
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), # Suppress vertical grid lines
        legend.position = c(0.1,0.8) # Place legend in lower right corner
        ) 
```


Chemicals along the x-axis are in order from lowest to highest median (50th percentile) predicted $C_{ss}$-dose slope. The orange points represent that 50th percentile $C_{ss}$-dose slope for each chemical. The green points represent the 5th percentile $C_{ss}$-dose slopes, and the purple points represent the 95th percentile $C_{ss}$-dose slope for each chemical. Each chemical has one orange point (50th percentile), one green point (5th percentile), and one purple point (95th percentile), characterizing the distribution of $C_{ss}$-dose slopes across the U.S. population for that chemical. The width of the distribution for each chemical is roughly represented by the vertical distance between the green and purple points for that chemical.

:::question
<i>With this, we can answer **Environmental Health Question 4**:</i>
Considering the chemicals evaluated in the above TK modeling example, do the $C_{ss}$-dose slope distributions become wider as the median $C_{ss}$-dose slope increases?
:::
:::answer
**Answer**:  No -- the $C_{ss}$-dose slope distributions generally become narrower as the median $C_{ss}$-dose slope increases. This can be seen by looking at the right end of the plot, where the highest-median chemicals are located -- the distance between the green points and purple points, representing the 5th and 95th percentiles, are much smaller for these higher-median chemicals.

#### Reverse TK: Calculating Administered Equivalent Doses for ToxCast Bioactive Concentrations

As described in an earlier section of this training module, the slope defining the linear relation between $C_{ss}$ and dose is useful for reverse toxicokinetics: converting an internal dose metric to an external dose metric. The internal dose metric may, for example, be a concentration associated with an *in vivo* health effect, or *in vitro* bioactivity. Here, we will consider *in vitro* bioactivity -- specifically, from the ToxCast program. ToxCast tests chemicals in multiple concentration-response format across a battery of *in vitro* assays that measure activity in a wide variety of biological endpoints. If a chemical showed any activity in an assay at any of its tested concentrations, then one metric of concentration associated with bioactivity is AC50 -- the concentration at which the assay response is halfway between its minimum and its maximum. 

The module won't address the details of how ToxCast determines assay activity and AC50s from raw concentration-response data. There is an entire R package for the ToxCast data processing workflow, called `tcpl`. If you want to learn more about those details, [start here](https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxcast-data-generation-toxcast-pipeline-tcpl). Lots of information is available if you install the `tcpl` R package and look at the package vignette; it essentially walks you through the full ToxCast data processing workflow.

In this module, we will begin with pre-computed ToxCast AC50 values for various chemicals and assays. We will use `httk` to convert ToxCast AC50 values into administered equivalent doses (AEDs).

#### Loading ToxCast AC50s

The latest public release of ToxCast high-throughput screening assay data can be downloaded [here](https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/exploring-toxcast-data-downloadable-data). Previous public releases of ToxCast data included a matrix of AC50s by chemical and assay. The data format of the latest public release does not contain this kind of matrix. So this dataset was pre-processed to prepare a simple data.frame of AC50s for each chemical/assay combination for the purposes of this training module.

Read in the pre-processed data set and view the first few rows.

```{r}
toxcast <- read.csv("Module2_5/Module2_5_TK_Toxcast_Data.csv")
head(toxcast)
```

The columns of this data frame are:

* `Compound`: The compound name.

* `CAS`: The compound's CASRN.

* `DTXSID`: The compound's DSSTox Substance ID.

* `aenm`: Assay identifier. "aenm" stands for "Assay Endpoint Name." More information about the ToxCast assays is available on the [ToxCast data download page](https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/exploring-toxcast-data-downloadable-data).

* `log10_ac50`: The AC50 for the chemical/assay combination on each row, in log10 uM units.

#### Subsetting the ToxCast Chemicals

Not all of the ToxCast chemicals have TK data built into `httk` such that we can perform reverse TK using the HTTK models. Let's subset the ToxCast data to include only the chemicals for which we can run the 3-compartment steady-state models. 

Previously, we used `get_cheminfo()` to get a list of chemicals for which we could run the 3-compartment steady state model, including the names, CASRNs, and DSSTox IDs of those chemicals. That list is stored in variable `chems_3compss`, a data.frame with compound name, CASRN, and DTXSID. Now, we can use that chemical list to subset the ToxCast data.

```{r}
toxcast_httk <- subset(toxcast,
                       subset = toxcast$DTXSID %in%
                         chems_3compss$DTXSID)
```

How many chemicals are in this subset?

```{r}
length(unique(toxcast_httk$DTXSID))
```

There were 998 `httk` chemicals for which we could run the 3-compartment steady-state model; only 911 of them had ToxCast data. Conversely, most of the 7863 ToxCast chemicals do not have TK data in `httk` such that we can run the 3-compartment steady state model.

#### Identifying the Lower-Bound 

ToxCast/Tox21 screens chemicals across multiple assays, such that each chemical has multiple resulting AC50 values, spanning a range of values. For example, here are boxplots of the AC50s for the first 20 chemicals listed in `chems_3compss`. Note that the chemical identifiers, DTXSID, are used here in these visualizations to represent unique chemicals.

```{r}
ggplot(toxcast_httk[toxcast_httk$DTXSID %in%
                      chems_3compss[1:20,
                                    "DTXSID"],
                    ]
       ) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=DTXSID, y = log10_ac50)) +
  ylab("log10 AC50") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,
                                   hjust = 1))
```


Sometimes we have an interest in getting the equivalent dose for an AC50 for one specific assay. For example, if we happen to be interested in estrogen-receptor activity, we might look specifically at one of the assays that measures estrogen receptor activity. 

However, sometimes we just want a general idea of what concentrations showed bioactivity in *any* of the ToxCast assays, regardless of the specific biological endpoint of each assay. In this case, typically, we are interested in a "reasonable lower bound" of bioactive concentrations across assays for each chemical. Intuitively, we suspect that the very lowest AC50s for each chemical might represent false activity. Therefore, we often select the tenth percentile of ToxCast AC50s for each chemical as that "reasonable lower bound" on bioactive concentrations.

Let's calculate the tenth percentile ToxCast AC50 for each chemical. Here, we use the base-R function `aggregate`, which groups a vector (specified in the `x` argument) by a list of factors (specified in the `by` argument), and applies a function to each group (specified in the `FUN` argument). You can add any extra arguments to the `FUN` function as named arguments to `aggregate`.

```{r}
toxcast_httk_P10 <- aggregate(x = toxcast_httk$log10_ac50, # Aggregate the AC50s
                              by = list(DTXSID = toxcast_httk$DTXSID), # Group AC50s by DTXSID
                              FUN = quantile, # The function to apply to each group
                              prob = 0.1) # An argument to the quantile() function
# By default the names of the output data.frame will be 'DTXSID' and 'x'
# Let's change 'x' to be a more informative name
names(toxcast_httk_P10) <- c("DTXSID", "log10_ac50_P10")
```

Let's transform the tenth-percentile AC50 values back to the natural scale (they are currently on the log10 scale) and put them in a new column `AC50`. These AC50s will be in uM.

```{r}
toxcast_httk_P10$AC50 <- 10^(toxcast_httk_P10$log10_ac50_P10)
```

View the first few rows:

```{r}
head(toxcast_httk_P10)
```


#### Calculating Equivalent Doses for 10th Percentile ToxCast AC50s

We can calculate equivalent doses in one line of R code -- again including all of the Monte Carlo for TK uncertainty and variability -- just by using the `httk` function `calc_mc_oral_equiv()`.

Note that in `calc_mc_oral_equiv()`, the `which.quantile` argument refers to the quantile of the $C_{ss}$-dose slope, not the quantile of the equivalent dose itself. So specifying `which.quantile = 0.95` will yield a *lower* equivalent dose than `which.quantile = 0.05`. 

Under the hood, `calc_mc_oral_equiv()` first calls `calc_mc_css()` to get percentiles of the $C_{ss}$-dose slope for a chemical. It then divides a user-specified target concentration (specified in argument `conc`) by each quantile of $C_{ss}$-dose slope to get the equivalent dose corresponding to that target concentration for each slope quantile.

Here, we're using the `mapply()` function in base R to call `calc_mc_oral_equiv()` in a loop over chemicals. This is because `calc_mc_oral_equiv()` requires two chemical-specific arguments -- the chemical identifier and the concentration for which to compute the equivalent dose. `mapply()` lets us provide vectors of values for each argument (in the named arguments `dtxsid` and `conc`), and will automatically loop over those vectors. We also use the argument `MoreArgs`, a named list of additional arguments to the function in `FUN` that will be the same for every iteration of the loop. Note that this line of code takes a few minutes to run.

```{r}
set.seed(42)

system.time(
  suppressWarnings(
  toxcast_equiv_dose <- mapply(FUN = calc_mc_oral_equiv,
  conc = toxcast_httk_P10$AC50,
    dtxsid = toxcast_httk_P10$DTXSID,
  MoreArgs = list(model = "3compartmentss",  # Model to use
                  which.quantile = c(0.05, 0.5, 0.95), # Quantiles of Css-dose slope
                       suppress.messages = TRUE)
  )
)
)

# By default, the results are a 3 x 911 matrix, where rows are quantiles and columns are chemicals

toxcast_equiv_dose <- t(toxcast_equiv_dose) # Transpose so that rows are chemicals
toxcast_equiv_dose <- as.data.frame(toxcast_equiv_dose) # Convert to data.frame
head(toxcast_equiv_dose) # Look at first few rows
```

Let's add the DTXSIDs back into this data.frame.

```{r}
toxcast_equiv_dose$DTXSID <- toxcast_httk_P10$DTXSID
```

We can get the names of these chemicals by using the list of chemicals for which the 3-compartment steady-state model can be parameterized, which was stored in the variable ``chems_3compss`. In that dataframe, we have the compound name and CASRN corresponding to each DTXSID.

```{r}
head(chems_3compss)
```


Merge `chems_3compss` with `toxcast_equiv_dose`.

```{r}
toxcast_equiv_dose <- merge(chems_3compss,
                            toxcast_equiv_dose,
                            by = "DTXSID",
                            all.x = FALSE,
                            all.y = TRUE)

head(toxcast_equiv_dose)
```

To find the chemicals with the lowest equivalent doses at the 95th percentile level (corresponding to the most-sensitive 5\% of the population), sort this data.frame in ascending order on the `95%` column.

```{r}
toxcast_equiv_dose <- toxcast_equiv_dose[order(toxcast_equiv_dose$`95%`), ]
head(toxcast_equiv_dose, 10) # First ten rows of sorted table
```

#### Comparing Equivalent Doses Estimated to Elicit Toxicity (Hazard) to External Exposure Estimates (Exposure), for Chemical Prioritization by Bioactivity-Exposure Ratios (BERs)

To estimate potential risk, hazard -- in the form of the equivalent dose for the 10th percentile Toxcast AC50 -- now needs to be compared to exposure. A quantitative metric for this comparison is the ratio of the lowest 5\% of equivalent doses to the highest 5\% of potential exposures. This metric is termed the Bioactivity-Exposure Ratio, or BER. Lower BER corresponds to higher potential risk. With BERs calculated for each chemical, we can ultimately rank all of the chemicals from lowest to highest BER, to achieve a chemical prioritization based on potential risk.

#### Human Exposure Estimates

Here, we will use exposure estimates that have been inferred from CDC NHANES urinary biomonitoring data (Ring et al., 2019). These estimates consist of an estimated median, and estimated upper and lower 95\% credible interval bounds representing uncertainty in that estimated median. These estimates are provided here in the following csv file:

```{r}
exposure <- read.csv("Module2_5/Module2_5_TK_Exposure_Data.csv")
head(exposure) # View first few rows
```

#### Merging Exposure Estimates with Equivalent Dose Estimates of Toxicity (Hazard)

To calculate a BER for a chemical, it needs to have both an equivalent dose and an exposure estimate. Not all of the chemicals for which equivalent doses could be computed (*i.e.*, chemicals with both ToxCast AC50s and `httk` data) also have exposure estimates inferred from NHANES. Find out how many do.

```{r}
length(intersect(toxcast_equiv_dose$DTXSID, exposure$DTXSID))
```

This means that, using the ToxCast AC50 data for bioactive concentrations, the NHANES urinary inference data for exposures, and the `httk` package to convert bioactive concentrations to equivalent doses, we can compute BERs for `r length(intersect(toxcast_equiv_dose$DTXSID, exposure$DTXSID))` chemicals.

Merge together the ToxCast equivalent doses and the exposure data into a single data frame. Keep only the chemicals that have data in both ToxCast equivalent doses and exposure data frames.

```{r}
hazard_exposure <- merge(toxcast_equiv_dose,
                         exposure,
                         by = "DTXSID",
                         all = FALSE)
head(hazard_exposure) # View first few rows of result
```

#### Plotting Hazard and Exposure Together

We can visually compare the equivalent doses and the inferred exposure estimates by plotting them together.

```{r}
ggplot(hazard_exposure) +
  geom_crossbar(aes(x = Compound.x, # Boxes for equivalent doses
                     y = `50%`,
                    ymax = `5%`,
                    ymin = `95%`,
                    color = "Equiv. dose")) +
  geom_crossbar(aes( x= Compound.x, # Boxes for exposures
                     y = Median,
                     ymax = up95,
                     ymin = low95,
                     color = "Exposure")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Equiv. dose" = "black",
                                "Exposure" = "Orange"),
                     name = NULL) +
  scale_x_discrete(label = function(x) str_trunc(x, 20)
                   ) + # Truncate chemical names to 20 chars
  scale_y_log10() +
  annotation_logticks(sides = "l") +
  ylab("Equiv. dose or Exposure, mg/kg/day") +
 theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,
                                   hjust = 1,
                                   size = 6),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "top")
```

## Calculating Bioactivity-Exposure Ratios (BERs)

The bioactivity-exposure ratio (BER) is simply the ratio of the lower-end equivalent dose (for the most-sensitive 5\% of the population) divided by the upper-end estimated exposure (here, the upper bound on the inferred population median exposure). In the data frame `hazard_exposure` containing the hazard and exposure data, the lower-end equivalent dose is in column `95%` (corresponding to the 95th-percentile $C_{ss}$-dose slope) and the upper-end exposure is in column `up95`. Calculate the BER, and assign the result to a new column in the `hazard_exposure` data frame called `BER`.

```{r}
hazard_exposure[["BER"]] <- hazard_exposure[["95%"]]/hazard_exposure[["up95"]]
```

#### Prioritizing Chemicals by BER

To prioritize chemicals according to potential risk, they can be sorted from lowest to highest BER. The lower the BER, the higher the priority.

Sort the rows of the data.frame from lowest to highest BER.

```{r}
hazard_exposure <- hazard_exposure[order(hazard_exposure$BER), ]
head(hazard_exposure)
```

The hazard-exposure plot above showed chemicals in alphabetical order. It can be revised to show chemicals in order of priority, from lowest to highest BER.

First, create a categorical (factor) variable for the compound names, whose levels are in order of increasing BER. (Since we already sorted the data.frame in order of increasing BER, we can just take the compound names in the order that they appear.)

```{r}
hazard_exposure$Compound_factor <- factor(hazard_exposure$Compound.x,
                                          levels = hazard_exposure$Compound.x)

```

Now, make the same plot as before, but use `Compound_factor` as the x-axis variable instead of `Compound`.

```{r}
ggplot(hazard_exposure) +
  geom_crossbar(aes(x = Compound_factor, # Boxes for equivalent dose
                     y = `50%`,
                    ymax = `5%`,
                    ymin = `95%`,
                    color = "Equiv. dose")) +
  geom_crossbar(aes( x= Compound_factor, # Boxes for exposure
                     y = Median,
                     ymax = up95,
                     ymin = low95,
                     color = "Exposure")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Equiv. dose" = "black",
                                "Exposure" = "Orange"),
                     name = NULL) +
    scale_x_discrete(label = function(x) str_trunc(x, 20)
                   ) + # Truncate chemical names
  scale_y_log10() +
  ylab("Equiv. dose or Exposure, mg/kg/day") +
  annotation_logticks(sides = "l") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,
                                   hjust = 1,
                                   size = 6),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "top")
```


Now, the chemicals are displayed in order of increasing BER. From left to right, you can visually see the distance increase between the lower bound of equivalent doses (the bottom of the black boxes) and the upper bound of exposure estimates (the top of the orange boxes). Since the y-axis is put on a log10 scale, the distance between the boxes corresponds to the BER. We can gather a lot of information from this plot!

:::question
<i>With this, we can answer **Environmental Health Question 7**:</i>
Based on httk modeling estimates, are chemicals with higher bioactivity-exposure ratios always less potent than chemicals with lower bioactivity-exposure ratios?
:::
:::answer
**Answer**: No -- some chemicals with high potency (low equivalent doses) demonstrate high BERs because they have relatively low human exposure estimates; and vice versa.

Based on httk modeling estimates, do chemicals with higher bioactivity-exposure ratios always have lower estimated exposures than chemicals with lower bioactivity-exposure ratios?
:::
:::answer
**Answer**: No -- some chemicals with high estimated exposures have equivalent doses that are higher still, resulting in a high BER despite the higher estimated exposure. Likewise, some chemicals with low estimated exposures also have lower equivalent doses, resulting in a low BER despite the low estimated exposure.

:::question
<i>With this, we can answer **Environmental Health Question 9**:</i>
How are chemical prioritization results different when using only hazard information vs. only exposure information vs. bioactivity-exposure ratios?
:::
:::answer
**Answer**: When chemicals are prioritized solely on the basis of hazard, more-potent chemicals will be highly prioritized. However, if humans are never exposed to these chemicals, or exposure is extremely low compared to potency, then despite the high potency, the potential risk may be low. Conversely, if chemicals are prioritized solely on the basis of exposure, then ubiquitous chemicals will be highly prioritized. However, if these chemicals are inert and do not produce adverse effects, then despite the high exposure, the potential risk may be low. For these reasons, risk-based chemical prioritization efforts consider both hazard (toxicity) and exposure, for instance through bioactivity-exposure ratios.

#### Filling Hazard and Exposure Data Gaps to Prioritize More Chemicals

To calculate a BER for a chemical, both bioactivity and exposure data are required, as well as sufficient TK data to perform reverse TK. In this training module, bioactivity data came from ToxCast AC50s; exposure data consisted of exposure inferences made from NHANES urinary biomonitoring data; and TK data consisted of parameter values measured *in vitro* and built into the `httk` R package. The intersections are illustrated in an Euler diagram below. BERs can only be calculated for chemicals in the triple intersection.

```{r}
fit <- eulerr::euler(list('ToxCast AC50s' = unique(toxcast$DTXSID),
                   'HTTK' = unique(chems_3compss$DTXSID),
                   'NHANES inferred exposure' = unique(exposure$DTXSID)
                   ),
                   shape = "ellipse")
plot(fit,
     legend = TRUE,
                   quantities = TRUE
              )
```

Clearly, it would be useful to gather more data to allow calculation of BERs for more chemicals. 


<br>

:::question
<i>With this, we can answer **Environmental Health Question 10**:</i>
Of the three data sets used in this training module -- bioactivity from ToxCast, TK data from `httk`, and exposure inferred from NHANES urinary biomonitoring -- which one most limits the number of chemicals that can be prioritized using BERs?
:::
:::answer
**Answer**: The exposure data set includes the fewest chemicals and is therefore the most limiting.
:::

<br>

The exposure data set used in this training module is limited to chemicals for which NHANES did urinary biomonitoring for markers of exposure, which is a fairly small set of chemicals that were of interest to NHANES due to existing concerns about health effects of exposure, and/or other reasons. This data set was chosen because it is a convenient set of exposure estimates to use for demonstration purposes, but it could be expanded by including other sources of exposure data and exposure model predictions. Further discussion is beyond the scope of this training module, but as an example of this kind of high-throughput exposure modeling, see [Ring et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30516957/).

It would additionally be useful to gather TK data for additional chemicals. *In vitro* measurement efforts are ongoing. Additonally, *in silico* modeling can produce useful predictions of TK properties to facilitate chemical prioritization. Efforts are ongoing to develop computational models to predict TK parameters from chemical structure and properties.

## Concluding Remarks
This training module provides an overview of toxicokinetic modeling using the `httk` R package, and its application to *in vitro*-*in vivo* extrapolation in the form of placing *in vitro* data in the context of exposure by calculating equivalent doses for *in vitro* bioactive concentrations. 

We would like to acknowledge the developers of the httk package, as detailed below via the CRAN website:

```



This module also summarizes the use of the Bioactivity-Exposure Ratio (BER) for chemical prioritization, and provides examples of calculating the BER and ranking chemicals accordingly.

Together, these approaches can be used to more efficiently identify chemicals present in the environment that pose a potential risk to human health.

#### Introduction to Chemical Read-Across
The method of **read-across** represents one type of computational approach that is commonly used to predict a chemical's toxicological effects using its properties. Other types of approaches that you will hear commonly used in this field include **SAR** and **QSAR** analyses. A high-level overview of each of these definitions and simple illustrative examples of these three computational modeling approaches is provided in the following schematic:

```{r, echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics("Module2_6/Module2_6_QSAR_ReadAcross_Overview.png")
```



Focusing more on read-across, this computational approach represents the method of filling a data gap whereby a chemical with existing data values is used to make a prediction for a 'similar' chemical, typically one which is structurally similar. Thus, information from chemicals with data is read across to chemical(s) without data. 

In a typical read-across workflow, the first step is to determine the problem definition - what question are we trying to address. The second step starts the process of identifying chemical analogues that have information that can be used to inform this question, imparting information towards a chemical of interest that is lacking data. A specific type of read-across that is commonly employed is termed 'Generalized Read-Across' or GenRA, which is based upon similarity-weighted activity predictions. This type of read-across approach will be used here when conducting the example chemical read-across training module. This approach has been previously described and published:

## Introduction to Training Module
In this activity we are going to consider a chemical of interest (which we call the target chemical) that is lacking acute oral toxicity information. Specifically, we would like to obtain estimates of the dose that causes lethality after acute (meaning, short-term) exposure conditions. These dose values are typically presented as LD50 values, and are usually collected through animal testing. There is huge interest surrounding the reduced reliance upon animal testing, and we would like to avoid further animal testing as much as possible. With this goal in mind, this activity aims to estimate an LD50 value for the target chemical using completely computational approaches, leveraging existing data as best we can. To achieve this aim, we explore ways in which we can search for structurally similar chemicals that have acute toxicity data already available. Data on these structurally similar chemicals, termed 'source analogues', are then used to predict acute toxicity for the target chemical of interest using the GenRA approach.

The dataset used for this training module were previously compiled and published in the following manuscript:
Helman G, Shah I, Patlewicz G. Transitioning the Generalised Read-Across approach (GenRA) to quantitative predictions: A case study using acute oral toxicity data. Comput Toxicol. 2019 Nov 1;12(November 2019):10.1016/j.comtox.2019.100097. doi: 10.1016/j.comtox.2019.100097. PMID: 33623834; PMCID: PMC7898163.

- With associated data available at: https://github.com/USEPA/CompTox-GenRA-acutetox-comptoxicol/tree/master/input


This exercise will specifically predict LD50 values for the chemical, 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene (DTXSID5020281). This chemical is an organic compound with the formula ClC6H4NO2, and is a common intermediate in the production of a number of industrial compounds, including common antioxidants found in rubber.


#### Training Module's **Environmental Health Questions**
This training module was specifically developed to answer the following environmental health questions:

(1) How many chemicals with acute toxicity data are structurally similar to 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene?
(2) What is the predicted LD50 for 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene, using the GenRA approach?
(3) How different is the predicted vs. experimentally observed LD50 for 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene?

## Read-Across Example Analysis 

#### Loading Example Datasets
Let's start by loading the datasets needed for this training module. We are going to use a dataset of substances that have chemical identification information ready in the form of SMILES, as well as acute toxicity data, in the form of LD50 values.

The first file to upload is named 'substances.csv', and contains the list of substances and their structural information, in the form of SMILES nomenclature. SMILES stands for Simplified molecular-input line-entry system, a form of line notation to describe the structure of a chemical.

The second file to upload is named 'acute_tox_data.csv', and contains the substances and their acute toxicity information.

```{r}
substances <- read.csv("Module2_6/Module2_6_Substances.csv")
acute_data <- read.csv("Module2_6/Module2_6_AcuteToxData.csv")
```

<br>

#### Data Viewing


Let's first view the substances dataset:
```{r}
dim(substances)
```

```{r}
colnames(substances)
```

```{r}
head(substances)
```
We can see that this dataset contains information on 6955 chemicals (rows), that are represented by DTXSIDs, a substance identifier provided through the U.S. EPA's Computational Toxicology Dashboard: https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard. Chemical identifiers are also presented as SMILES and QSAR_READY_SMILES. The QSAR_READY_SMILES values are what we will specifically need in a later step, to construct chemical fingerprints from. QSAR_READY_SMILES refers to SMILES that have been standardized related to salts, tautomers, inorganics, aromaticity, and stereochemistry (among other factors) prior to any QSAR modeling or prediction. Let's make sure that these values are recognized as character format and placed in its own vector, to ensure proper execution of functions throughout this script:


```{r}
all_smiles <- as.character(substances$QSAR_READY_SMILES)
```

<br>

Now let's view the acute toxicity dataset:
```{r}
dim(acute_data)
```

```{r}
colnames(acute_data)
```

```{r}
head(acute_data)
```

We can see that this dataset contains information on 6955 chemicals (rows), that are again represented by DTXSIDs. In this file, we will use data within the 'LD50_LM' column, which represents the -log10 of the millimolar LD50. LD stands for 'Lethal Dose'. The LD50 value is the dose of substance given all at once which causes the death of 50% of a group of test animals. The lower the LD50 in mg/kg, the more toxic that substance is. 

#### Important Notes on Units
In modeling studies, the convention is to convert toxicity values expressed as mg per unit into their molar or millimolar values and then to convert these to the base 10 logarithm. To increase clarity when plotting, such that higher toxicities would be expressed by higher values, the negative logarithm is then taken. For example, substance DTXSID00142939 has a molecular weight of 99.089 (grams per mole) and a LD50 of 32 mg/kg. This would be converted to a toxicity value of 32/99.089 = 0.322942 mmol/kg. The logarithm of that would be -0.4908755. By convention, the negative logarithm of the millimolar concentration would then be used i.e. -log[mmol/kg]. This conversion has been used to create the LD50_LM values in the acute toxicity dataset. 


Let's check to see whether the same chemicals are present in both datasets:
```{r}
# First need to make sure that both dataframes are sorted by the identifier, DTXSID
substances <- substances[order(substances$DTXSID),]
acute_data <- acute_data[order(acute_data$DTXSID),]
# Then test to see whether data in these columns are equal
unique(substances$DTXSID == acute_data$DTXSID)
```
All accounts are true, meaning they are all equal (the same chemical)

<br><br>

#### Data Visualizations of Acute Toxicity Values
Let's create a plot to show the distribution of the LD50 values in the dataset.

```{r}
ggplot(data = acute_data, aes(LD50_mgkg)) + stat_ecdf(geom = "point")

ggplot(data = acute_data, aes(LD50_LM)) + stat_ecdf(geom = "point")

```



**Can you see a difference between these two plots?**
Yes, if the LD50 mg/kg values are converted into -log[mmol/kg] scale (LD50_LM), then the distribution resembles a normal cumulative distribution curve.

<br><br>

#### Selecting the 'Target' Chemical of Interest for Read-Across Analysis
For this exercise, we will select a 'target' substance of interest from our dataset, and assume that we have no acute toxicity data for it, and we will perform read-across for this target chemical. Note that this module's example dataset actually has full data coverage (meaning all chemicals have acute toxicity data), but this exercise is beneficial, because we can make toxicity predictions, and then check to see how close we are by viewing the experimentally observed values.

Our target substance for this exercise is going to be DTXSID5020281, which is 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene. This chemical is an organic compound with the formula ClC6H4NO2, and is a common intermediate in the production of a number of industrially useful compounds, including common antioxidants found in rubber. Here is an image of the chemical structure (https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/dsstoxdb/results?search=DTXSID5020281):

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'} 
knitr::include_graphics("Module2_6/Module2_6_TargetChemical_Image.png")
```


Filtering the dataframes for only data on this target substance:

```{r}
target_substance <-filter(substances, DTXSID == 'DTXSID5020281')
target_acute_data <- filter(acute_data, DTXSID == 'DTXSID5020281')
```

<br>

#### Calculating Structural Similarities between Substances
To eventually identify chemical analogues with information that can be 'read-across' to our target chemical  (1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene), we first need to evaluate how similar each chemical is to one another. In this example, we will base our search for similar substances upon similarities between chemical structure fingerprint representations. Once these chemical structure fingerprints are derived, they will be used to calculate the degree to which each possible pair of chemicals is similar, leveraging the Tanimoto metric. These findings will yield a similarity matrix of all possible pairwise similarity scores.


#### Converting Chemical Identifiers into Molecular Objects (MOL)
To derive structure fingerprints across all evaluated substances, we need to first convert the chemical identifiers originally provided as 'QSAR_READY_SMILES' into molecular objects. The standard exchange format for molecular information is a MOL file. This is a chemical file format that contains plain text information and stores information about atoms, bonds and their connections.


We can carry out these identifier conversions using the 'parse.smiles' function within the rcdk package. Here we do this for the target chemical of interest, as well as all substances in the dataset.
```{r}
target_mol <- parse.smiles(as.character(target_substance$QSAR_READY_SMILES)) 
all_mols <-parse.smiles(all_smiles)
```


#### Computing chemical fingerprints

With these mol data, we can now compute the fingerprints for our target substance, as well as all the substances in the dataset. We can compute fingerprints leveraging the 'get.fingerprint' function. Let's first run it on the target chemical:
```{r}
target.fp <- get.fingerprint(target_mol[[1]], type = 'standard')
target.fp # View fingerprint
```


We can run the same function over the entire 'all_mols' dataset, leveraging the lapply function:
```{r}
all.fp <- lapply(all_mols, get.fingerprint, type='standard')
```


## Calculating Chemical Similarities

Using these molecular fingerprint data, we can now calculate the degree to which each chemical is similar to another chemical, based on structural similarity. The method employed in this example is the Tanimoto method. The Tanimoto similarity metric is a unitless number between zero and one that measures how similar two sets (in this case 2 chemicals) are from one another. A Tanimoto index of 1 means the 2 chemicals are identical whereas a index of 0 means that the chemicals share nothing in common. In the context of the fingerprints, a Tanimoto index of 0.5 means that half of the fingerprint matches between two chemicals whilst the other half does not match. 

Once these Tanimoto similarity indices are calculated between every possible chemical pair, the similarity results can be viewed in the form of a similarity matrix. In this matrix, all substances are listed across the rows and columns, and the degree to which every possible chemical pair is similar is summarized through values contained within the matrix. Further information about chemical similarity can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_similarity

Steps to generate this similarity matrix are detailed here:
```{r}
all.fp.sim <- fingerprint::fp.sim.matrix(all.fp, method = 'tanimoto')
all.fp.sim <- as.data.frame(all.fp.sim) # Convert the outputted matrix to a dataframe
colnames(all.fp.sim) = substances$DTXSID # Placing chemical identifiers back as column headers
row.names(all.fp.sim) = substances$DTXSID # Placing chemical identifiers back as row names
```


Since we are querying a large number of chemicals, it is difficult to view the entire resulting similarity matrix. Let's, instead view portions of these results:
```{r}
all.fp.sim[1:5,1:5] # Viewing the first five rows and columns of data
```


```{r}
all.fp.sim[6:10,6:10] # Viewing the next five rows and columns of data
```
You can see that there is an identity line within this similarity matrix, where instances when a chemical's structure is being compared to itself, the similarity values are 1.00000.

All other possible chemical pairings show variable similarity scores, ranging from:
```{r}
min(all.fp.sim)
```
a minimum of zero, indicating no similarities between chemical structures.

```{r}
max(all.fp.sim)
```
a maximum of 1, indicating the identical chemical structure (which occurs when comparing a chemical to itself).


<br>

#### Identifying Chemical Analogues
This step will find substances that are structurally similar to the target chemical, 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene (with DTXSID5020281). Structurally similar chemicals are referred to as 'source analogues', with information that will be carried forward in this read-across analysis.


The first step to identifying chemical analogues is to subset the full similarity matrix to focus just on our target chemical.
```{r}
target.sim <- all.fp.sim %>% filter(row.names(all.fp.sim) == 'DTXSID5020281')
```


Then we'll extract the substances that exceed a similarity threshold of 0.75 by selecting to keep columns which are > 0.75.

```{r}
target.sim <- target.sim %>% select_if(function(x) any(x > 0.75))
dim(target.sim) # Show dimensions of subsetted matrix
```


This gives us our analogues list! Specifically, we selected 12 columns of data, representing our target chemical plus 11 structurally similar chemicals. Let's create a dataframe of these substance identifiers to carry forward in the read-across analysis:
```{r}
source_analogues <- t(target.sim) # Transposing the filtered similarity matrix results
DTXSID <-rownames(source_analogues) # Temporarily grabbing the dtxsid identifiers from this matrix
source_analogues <- cbind(DTXSID, source_analogues) # Adding these identifiers as a column
rownames(source_analogues) <- NULL # Removing the rownames from this dataframe, to land on a cleaned dataframe
colnames(source_analogues) <- c('DTXSID', 'Target_TanimotoSim') # Renaming column headers
source_analogues[1:12,1:2] # Viewing the cleaned dataframe of analogues
```

**Answer**:  In this dataset, 11 chemicals are structurally similar to the target chemical, based on a Tanimoto similiary score of > 0.75.
:::

<br>


## Chemical Read-Across to Predict Acute Toxicity
Acute toxicity data from these chemical analogues can now be extracted and read across to the target chemical (1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene) to make predictions about its toxicity.


Let's first merge the acute data for these analogues into our working dataframe:
```{r}
source_analogues <- merge(source_analogues, acute_data, by.x = 'DTXSID', by.y = 'DTXSID')
```


Then, let's remove the target chemical of interest and create a new dataframe of just the source analogues:
```{r}
source_analogues_only <- source_analogues %>% filter(Target_TanimotoSim != 1) # Removing the row of data with the target chemical, identified as the chemical with a similarity of 1 to itself
```
<br>

#### Read-across Calculations using GenRA
The final generalized read-across (GenRA) prediction is based on a similarity-weighted activity score. This score is specifically calculated as the following weighted average: (pairwise similarity between the target and source analogue) * (the toxicity of the source analogue), summed across each individual analogue; and then this value is divided by the sum of all pairwise similarities. For further details surrounding this algorithm and its spelled out formulation, see [Shah et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27174420/).

Here are the underlying calculations needed to derive the similarity weighted activity score for this current exercise:
```{r}
source_analogues_only$wt_tox_calc <- 
  as.numeric(source_analogues_only$Target_TanimotoSim) * source_analogues_only$LD50_LM  
# Calculating (pairwise similarity between the target and source analogue) * (the toxicity of the source analogue) 
# for each analogy, and saving it as a new column titled 'wt_tox_calc'

sum_tox <- sum(source_analogues_only$wt_tox_calc) #Summing this wt_tox_calc value across all analogues

sum_sims <- sum(as.numeric(source_analogues_only$Target_TanimotoSim))  # Summing all of the pairwise Tanimoto similarity scores

ReadAcross_Pred <- sum_tox/sum_sims  # Final calculation for the weighted activity score (i.e., read-across prediction)
```

#### Converting LD50 Units
Right now, these results are in units of -log10 millimolar. So we still need to convert them into mg/kg equivalent, by converting out of -log10 and multiplying by the molecular weight of 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene (g/mol):
```{r}
ReadAcross_Pred <- (10^(-ReadAcross_Pred))*157.55
ReadAcross_Pred 
```

#### Comparing Read-Across Predictions to Experimental Observations
Let's now compare how close this computationally-based prediction is to the experimentally observed LD50 value

```{r}
target_acute_data$LD50_mgkg
```
We can see that the experimentally observed LD50 values for this chemical is 460 mg/kg

<i>With this, we can answer **Environmental Health Question 3**:</i>
How different is the predicted vs. experimentally observed LD50 for 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene?
:::
:::answer
**Answer**: The predicted LD50 is 471 mg/kg, and the experimentally observed LD50 is 460 mg/kg. Therefore, these values are very close!

## Concluding Remarks

In conclusion, this training module leverages a dataset of substances with structural representations and toxicity data to create chemical fingerprint representations. We have selected a chemical of interest (target) and used the most similar analogues based on a similarity threshold to predict the acute toxicity of that target using the generalized read-across formula of weighted activity by similarity. We have seen that the prediction is in close agreement with that already reported for the target chemical in the dataset. Similar methods can be used to predict other toxicity endpoints, based on other datasets of chemicals.
