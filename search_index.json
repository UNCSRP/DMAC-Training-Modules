The Data Analysis and Management Core (DMAC) provide the UNC-Superfund Research Program with critical expertise in bioinformatics, statistics, data management and data integration. Our goal is to support the data management, integration, and analysis needs of the researchers to reveal multi-factorial determinants of inorganic arsenic-induced metabolic dysfunction/diabetes.
