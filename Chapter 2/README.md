# Chemical-Biological Analyses and Predictive Modeling


This chapter of TAME Toolkit training modules covers approaches that can be used to carry out chemical and/or biological analyses and predictive modeling to better understand exposure-induced disease and underlying toxicological mechanisms. 

Modules span topics of: 

+ Dose-response modeling (module 2.1)
+ Machine learning and predictive modeling (2.2)
+ Mixtures analyses (2.3), 
+ -omics analyses and systems biology (2.4)
+ Toxicokinetic modeling (2.5)
+ Read-across toxicity predictions (2.6)
