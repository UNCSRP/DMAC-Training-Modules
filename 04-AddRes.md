# (PART) Additional Resources {-}









Here we provide additional resources that will benefit trainees who want to learn more about certain aspects of data science and computational methods discussed throughout these training modules. There are many additional resources available for learning more about data management and analysis methods. Select resources that we have found helpful are detailed below.


# R Programming Resources:

+ [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) provides online courses for many technical topics, including several on [R programming](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=r).

+ [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) provides online courses for learning R, Python, statistics, and more.

+ [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), developed by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, is an online resource that also comes in the format of a book, that teaches participants how to do data science using R.
  
+ [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/), developed by Winston Chang, is a practical guide that provides more than 150 "recipes" to demonstrate generating graphics in R quickly.
  
+	[R for Graduate Students](https://bookdown.org/yih_huynh/Guide-to-R-Book/), developed by a PhD student, Wendy Huynh, who taught herself R as a needed component of her research while obtaining a PhD and wanted to share her experience and lessons learned.

+	[Reproducible Medical Research with R](https://bookdown.org/pdr_higgins/rmrwr/), developed by Dr. Higgins as an online resource for those in the medical field interested in analyzing the data to better understand health, disease, or the delivery of care.


# R Packages Resources:
  
+ [R Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website](https://cran.r-project.org/)
  
+	[Bioconductor: Open Source Software for Bioinformatics website](https://www.bioconductor.org/)


# Community Discussions on R and R Packages:

+ [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions) online discussion forums.
  
+ Discussion forums within [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/), where you can communicate directly with package developers.


# Data Science and Statistical Analysis Resources:
  
+ [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print12_toc.pdf), written by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman.
