# The TAME Toolkit for Introductory Data Science, Chemical-Biological Analyses, Predictive Modeling, and Database Mining for Environmental Health Research

Research in exposure science, toxicology, and environmental health is becoming increasingly reliant upon data science and computational methods that can more efficiently extract information from complex datasets. These methods can be leveraged to better identify relationships between exposures to chemicals in the environment and human disease outcomes. Still, there remains a critical gap surrounding the training of researchers on these in silico methods.


We aimed to address this critical gap by developing the inTelligence And Machine lEarning (TAME) Toolkit, promoting trainee-driven data generation, management, and analysis methods to “TAME” data in environmental health studies. This toolkit encompasses training modules, organized as chapters within this Github Bookdown site. All underlying code (in RMarkdown), input files, and imported graphics for these modules can be found at the parent UNC-SRP Github Page.


Training modules were developed to provide applications-driven examples of data organization and analysis methods that can be used to address environmental health questions. Target audiences for these modules include students and professionals in academia, government, and industry that are interested in expanding their skillset. Modules were developed by study coauthors using annotated script formatted for R/RStudio coding language and interface and were organized into three chapters. 

1. The first chapter of modules focuses on introductory data science, which included the following topics: setting up R/RStudio and coding in the R environment; data organization basics; finding and visualizing data trends; high-dimensional data visualizations with heat maps; and Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) data management practices. 
2. The second chapter of modules incorporates chemical-biological analyses and predictive modeling, spanning the following methods: dose-response modeling; machine learning and predictive modeling; mixtures analyses; -omics analyses; toxicokinetic modeling; and read-across toxicity predictions. 
3. The last chapter of modules are organized to provide examples on environmental health database mining and integration, including chemical exposure, health outcome, and environmental justice data.
